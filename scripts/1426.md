# Get VMs on a LUN

### [download](1426.ps1)

Given a LUN, this script returns all VMs using that LUN. This technique uses the performance manager, which is not the only way to do it but is actually a very easy way to do it.

```posh
function Get-LunVM {
	param($Lun)

	Get-VM | Where {
		$_ | Get-Stat -stat disk.write.average -realtime -maxsamples 1 `
		    -erroraction SilentlyContinue |
			Where { $_.Instance -eq $Lun } }
}

```
