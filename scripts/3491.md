The script saves a username and password, encrypted with a custom key to to a file. The key is coded into the script but can be changed if required. The key allows the password to be decrypted by any user who has the key, on any machine. If the key parameter is omitted from ConvertFrom-SecureString, only the user who generated the file on the computer that generated the file can decrypt the password.
