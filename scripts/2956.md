# Get Old Outlook Events

### [download](2956.ps1)

This powershell script gets all outlook events that haven't been modified in three months and are recurring.
Good for auditing use of conference rooms for meetings that are still scheduled in outlook, but don't necessarily happen.
Works best if run as a resource account.
