# Measure-File

### [download](1030.ps1)

A lightweight function similar to unix's "wc" word count application. In my testing, this outputs the same numbers as wc, but without totals. See "Measure-Total":http://poshcode.org/1031 for a general-purpose numeric column "totals row" generating function :)

```posh

function Measure-File { 
Param([string[]]$file)
PROCESS{
   if(!$file -and $_)
   {$file = $_}
   # wrap it with get-childitem so we do each file...
   foreach($f in ls $file){
      gc $f -delim [char]0|
      measure -line -word -char |
      select Lines, Words, Characters, @{n="Name";e={$f.Name}}
   }
}} 
new-alias wc measure-file
