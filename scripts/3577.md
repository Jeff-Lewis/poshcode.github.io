description:    This script is called from a scheduled task running under an account with the recipient role. Gets identities from a distribution group in AD, here named xc2010move but it can be anything you like. This way anyone with permissions to add users to this group can initialize a migration and with the right permissions users can even add themselves to this group (add\remove Self as member).
(changed order of commands to remove users from DG and removed erroneous bracket slipped in while copying code, removed superfluous Identity parameter)

This script is called from a scheduled task running under an account with the recipient role. Gets identities from a distribution group in AD, here named xc2010move but it can be anything you like. This way anyone with permissions to add users to this group can initialize a migration and with the right permissions users can even add themselves to this group (add\remove Self as member).
(changed order of commands to remove users from DG and removed erroneous bracket slipped in while copying code, removed superfluous Identity parameter)

```posh
param(
