# WhileTimeout

### [download](609.ps1)

Generic wrapper for the While statement that will execute a condition a given number of max tries, waiting a given number of seconds in between.
This example will execute the "IsItDoneYet" function (that checks a hypothetical external factor) once every 5 seconds, a total of no more than 24 times, which will take approximately two minutes, not including function execution time.

> $condition = { IsItDoneYet }
> WhileTimeout 5 24 $condition


```posh
function WhileTimeout ( [int]$interval, [int]$maxTries, [scriptblock]$condition )
{
	$i = 0
	$startTime = Get-Date
	while ( &$condition ) {
		$i++
		if ( $i -lt $maxTries ) {
			Start-Sleep -seconds $interval
		} else {
			Throw "Operation exceeded timeout"
		}
	}
	$endTime = Get-Date
	$duration = ( $endTime - $startTime ).TotalSeconds
	Write-Verbose "Operation elapsed time: $duration seconds"
}


```
