# Get-Netstat 0.9

### [download](555.ps1) - [parent](554.md)"

This will perform a basic netstat.exe command and "objectize" its output.  This version only handles the TCP stuff because I ran out of time. This needs perhaps a switch statement and a second regex to do the rest justice.

I'd like to see in a v2 the capability to tie process names in via the PID column and output the real process name and file info and so on.

```posh
$null, $null, $null, $null, $netstat = netstat -a -n -o
[regex]$regex = '\s+(?<Protocol>\S+)\s+(?<LocalAddress>\S+)\s+(?<RemoteAddress>\S+)\s+(?<State>\S+)\s+(?<PID>\S+)'

$netstat | ForEach-Object {
       if ( $_ -match $regex ) {
               $process = "" | Select-Object Protocol, LocalAddress, RemoteAddress,
State, PID
               $process.Protocol = $matches.Protocol
               $process.LocalAddress = $matches.LocalAddress
               $process.RemoteAddress = $matches.RemoteAddress
               $process.State = $matches.State
               $process.PID = $matches.PID
               $process
       }
}
```
