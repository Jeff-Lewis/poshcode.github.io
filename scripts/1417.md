  DESCRIPTION:
    Queries Active Directory (currently logged into) for all computer objects,
    pings the computer first, then queries WMI. The MSNdis_CurrentPackFilter class
    in the root\WMI namespace is used. Next, the NdisCurrentPacketFilter property to
    see if the NDIS_PACKET_TYPE_PROMISCUOUS bit (0x00000020) is set. This determines
    if the NIC is is promiscuous mode.

  REQUIREMENTS:
    Proper rights to query WMI\Root on the remote computers is necessary.
