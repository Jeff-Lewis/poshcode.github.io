description:    Restoring Active Directory Objects via Recycle bin feature:
Pre-requisites and Notes:

    Active Directory Recycle Bin feature must be enabled – At present this feature is only available in Server 2008 R2
    Any objects prior to 180 days that have been deleted will be non-recoverable and a authorative restore will be required to restore deleted AD Objects
    Whichever method is used to restore an Object or objects the objects live parent must exist, thus an OU must be restored first before its child objects can be restored, additionally, if that parent OU had child OU’s the same rule will apply.
    It is critical to begin restoring objects from the highest level of the hierarchy because deleted objects must be restored to a live parent. 

 
1.   Restoring Single and Multiple Active Directory Objects via Script

    In this directory is a script called “Create_Restore.vbs” This script can be used to restore single as well as multiple Objects
    The script must be run on a DC
    The root of the folder that the script is run from will create 3 additional files and the script is also completely interactive 

Inner workings of the script:

    When the script is run, it will firstly create a Powershell script that will query AD and also pipe out the query into a txt file document, also created in the root of the directory. This txt file will then open itself and the user can basically see every object that lies within the recycle bin with some fields associated to the object. It is important to note the GUID of the object
    The script will then prompt the user to enter the GUID of the objects he/she wants to restore. It is important to add in the GUID’s for OU’s first starting with the highest level in the hierarchy first so that when later GUIDs for child objects will be restored correctly, multiple GUID’s can be entered as the script will ask if the user wants to add more. Bear in mind that the parent OU’s GUID’s must be entered first starting from the highest level of the hierarchy as they will need to be restored first before the child objects GUID’s are entered, this can be done by checking the txt report created in the previous step
    After all the GUID’s have been entered the scrip will create a final powershell script that will hold all the restore data based on the GUID’s entered by the user
    The script will then ask the user if he/she wants to commit the changes to AD and then commit the restore 

2.   Restoring Multiple Active Directory Objects under an OU

    It is critical to begin restoring objects from the highest level of the hierarchy because deleted objects must be restored to a live parent. 

 

 

Example (Someone deleted the OU called “Finance_Department”:

 

To restore the Finance_Department OU, you can perform the following procedure. It is vital to note that the OU itself must first be restored before it’s child objects can be restored.

Additionally, the child OU “Admins” will also be restored however, it’s child objects will not be restored, as a restore can only take place from an existing parent only on that level.

Thus each sub level must be restored separately.
To restore the Finance_Department OU

    Click Start, click Administrative Tools, right-click Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell, and then click Run as administrator.
    Restore the Finance_Department OU by running the following command at the Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell prompt: 

Get-ADObject -ldapFilter:"(msDS-LastKnownRDN=Finance_Department)" –IncludeDeletedObjects | Restore-ADObject

    Restore the user accounts Brian and Mary and the Admins OU (the direct children of the Finance_Department OU whose distinguished name was restored to OU=Finance_Department,DC=contoso,DC=com in the previous step) by running the following command at the Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell prompt: 

Get-ADObject -SearchBase "CN=Deleted Objects,DC=contoso,DC=com" -Filter {lastKnownParent -eq "OU=Finance_Department,DC=contoso,DC=com"} -IncludeDeletedObjects | Restore-ADObject

    Restore the user account Tom (the direct child of the Admins OU whose distinguished name was restored to OU=Admins,OU=Finance_Department,DC=contoso,DC=com in the previous step) by running the following command at the Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell prompt: 

Get-ADObject -SearchBase "CN=Deleted Objects,DC=contoso,DC=com" -Filter {lastKnownParent -eq "OU=Admins,OU=Finance_Department,DC=contoso,DC=com"} -IncludeDeletedObjects | Restore-ADObject

For any further reference, please see:

3.   Usefull Powershell Commands:

 

    To get a full list of all objects that are in the deleted state with all the attributes for each object you can run: 

Get-ADObject -filter 'isdeleted -eq $true -and name -ne "Deleted Objects"' -includeDeletedObjects -property *

 

    The same command with the necessary usefull filters would be: 

Get-ADobject -filter 'isdeleted -eq $true -and name -ne "Deleted Objects"' -includeDeletedObjects -property * | Format-List Deleted,DistinguishedName,samAccountName,LastKnownParent,ObjectGUID,ObjectClass

 

    To restore a single object: 

Restore-ADObject -identity “GUID”
