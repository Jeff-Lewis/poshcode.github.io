# Watch-SG2011LeaderBoard

### [download](2626.ps1)

My variation for SG 2011 Leader Board watcher. :) Using regex + xml. Lets you specify -Top and -Name, so that you see person even if she/he is not (yet ;) ) in top. :D

```posh
#requires -Version 2.0

<#
    .Synopsis
      
        Script that will produce table of leaders in a give category.

    .Description

        Just some fun with regex/ xml. :)
        It will grab SG 2011 Leader Board for a given category.
        Than parse the string, convert it into XML, create custom objects and in the end - produce nice table.
        Not really best practices, but well... it's all about display this time.
        Goes in loop, so it should keep leaderboard.
        And if you miss you name in topX - add it using -Name parameter. :)

    .Example

        Watch-SG2011LeaderBoard
        Starts using defaults: Advanced category, Top 10 users, 5 seconds delay, and 2011 SG url.
        
    .Example

        Watch-SG2011LeaderBoard -Categeroy Beg -Name ScriptingWife
        Show Beginner category, and include ScriptingWife regardless her current position. :)
