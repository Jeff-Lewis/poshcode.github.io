# ToDo: In this event, you must write a script that will count down from three minutes 
# to zero seconds. When the three minutes have expired,
# display a message indicating that the given amount of time has elapsed. 
#
# This solution uses the .Net System.Windows.Form and ...Drawing classes to produce a kind
# of GUI with a "stop-watch touch"
#
# The Start-Button starts the countdwon ... not very surpisingly :-)
# The countdown can be suspended by pressing the Stop-Button ... obviously
# You can Set the countdown timer in a range up to an hour ( 59:59 [mm:ss] )
# using the Set-Button. After entering a new valid mm:ss value press the Set-Button again
# to take these new values into effect
# I won't tell you, what the Exit-button might do for us :-)
#
# All the positioning and sizing has been done using the VS2008 designer too to avoid me
# having a heart attack trying to adjust pixelwise ... 
# But I'm no artist, so I didn't spent too much time beautifying the layout!
