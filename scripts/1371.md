# VM Last Poweron Time

### [download](1371.ps1)

Return a list of objects containing per-VM last powered on time.

This time may be inaccurate based on your event retention policy. If your VM was powered on at a time older than your retention policy, this function will not be able to detect that.

This works best against vCenter since ESX keeps a much smaller window of events available.

```posh
# Get a VM's last power on date based on the VM's events.
# Requires PowerCLI 4.0 and PowerShell v2.
function Get-LastPowerOn {
	param(
        [Parameter(
            Mandatory=$true,
            ValueFromPipeline=$true,
            HelpMessage="VM"
        )]
        [VMware.VimAutomation.Types.VirtualMachine]
        $VM
	)

	Process {
		# Patterns that indicate an attempt to power a VM on. This differ
		# across versions and likely across language. Please add your own
		# if you find one missing.
		$patterns = @(
			"*Power On virtual machine*",	# vCenter 4 English
			"*is starting*"					# ESX 4/3.5 English
		)

		$events = $VM | Get-VIEvent
		$qualifiedEvents = @()
		foreach ($pattern in $patterns) {
			$qualifiedEvents += $events | Where { $_.FullFormattedMessage -like $pattern }
		}
		$qualifiedEvents = $qualifiedEvents | Where { $_ -ne $null }
		$sortedEvents = Sort-Object -InputObject $qualifiedEvents -Property CreatedTime -Descending
		$event = $sortedEvents | select -First 1

		$obj = New-Object PSObject
		$obj | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name VM -Value $_
		$obj | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name PowerState -Value $_.PowerState
		$obj | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name LastPoweron -Value $null
		if ($event) {
			$obj.LastPoweron = $event.CreatedTime
		}

		Write-Output $obj
