# Profile Function

### [download](1848.ps1)

I have this function in my powershell profile. It will ask me if i want to start a transcript when I launch Posh. There's some conditional logic, it'll ask if you want to start the transcript. If you say yes it'll check to see if the Transcripts folder exists, if it doesn't it'll be created. Pretty cool. Got the main part of the code from Shay Levy's site and modified it.

```posh
########################################################
# This function will prompt the user asking if they want
# to start a transcript file. It will loop until the user
# types y or n. If the user selects y, the script will
# check to see if the transcript exists. If it doesn't
# it is created. If it does, the transcript file is created.
# The transcript started message, and folder creation
# message are all piped to null. Modified script from
# Shay's site http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/ScriptFanatic

function Save-Transcript{
$global:TRANSCRIPT = "C:\Scripts\PowerShell\Transcripts\PSLOG_{0:dd-MM-yyyy}.txt" -f (Get-Date)
Start-Transcript -Append | out-null
}
 
do{$a = Read-Host "Do you want to start a transcript? y/n"}
Until($a -ne "") 
If($a -eq "y")
{
if (Test-Path C:\Scripts\PowerShell\Transcripts)
{
"C:\Scripts\PowerShell\Transcripts"
}
else
{
New-Item C:\Scripts\PowerShell\Transcripts -type directory | out-null
}
Save-Transcript
}
```
