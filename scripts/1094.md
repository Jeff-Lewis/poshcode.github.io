# Interact with in-VM UI

### [download](1094.ps1)

Demostrates interaction with user interfaces running inside virtual machine. Based on VMware PowerCLI and WASP. Starts installalation of beta version of VMware tools, then simulates mouse click in unsigned driver confirmation window which appears inside the virtual machine.

```posh
# First, start asynchronous tools update. We need to do it in a separate process
# because the update is a beta version which contains unsigned drivers and will
# be blocked by Windows' driver confirmation prompt
$updateScript = "
Add-PSSnapin VMware.VimAutomation*
Connect-VIServer $DefaultVIServer
Get-VM 'OldVMTools' | Update-Tools
"

# Start the parallel process
[System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start('powershell.exe', $updateScript)

# This script will be executed inside the VM's guest OS.
# Note that WASP is preinstalled on the VM to keep the script simpler.
$confirmationScript = "
Add-PSSnapin WASP

# VMware tools includes multiple drivers so we need to click many times
for (`$i = 0; `$i -lt 5; ) {
	# In WASP, you usually find windows with Select-Window. The driver
	# confirmation is a bit strange though so we need to use Select-Control.
	# '-Window 0' means the desktop
	`$driverConfirmationWindow = `
         Select-Control -Window 0 -Recurse -Title 'Hardware Installation'
	
	if (`$driverConfirmationWindow -ne `$null) {
		`$driverConfirmationWindow |
		    Select-Control -title '&Continue Anyway' | Send-Click
		`$i++;
	}
	
	Start-Sleep 5;
}
"

#Send confirmation script to the guest
Invoke-VMScript `
    -vm 'OldVMTools' -guestUser 'user1' -guestPassword 'pass1' `
    -hostUser 'root' -hostPassword 'pass2' -script $confirmationScript

```
