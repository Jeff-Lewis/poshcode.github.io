description:    I was having a great deal of difficulty in properly enumerating software applications on remote machines, so I wrote this function to help ease the problem somewhat. Among the many methods of gathering this information that are available, I had the most success using the "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall" registry key as an information source. In order to use this function, the Powershell instance must support .Net 4.0 or greater, which is fairly straightforward if you follow these instructions.
1. Open notepad and copy the below text exactly as shown into the document.

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<configuration>
	<startup useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy="true">
		<supportedRuntime version="v4.0.30319"/>
		<supportedRuntime version="v2.0.50727"/>
	</startup>
</configuration>

2. Save this document as c:\windows\System32\WindowsPowerhsell\v1.0\Powershell.exe.config (or c:\windows\System32\WindowsPowerhsell\v1.0\Powershell_ise.exe.config)
3. Reload powershell and type the following command: $PsVersionTable.clrVersion (It should show Major version 4 if .Net 4 is supported.)

Take note that this release does not contain error checking functions that my production version uses, I removed references to these functions in order to provide a good starting function for others to use. If you have any errors with this code, please contact me and I will resolve them as soon as possible.

Function Get-Software{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Gets the software applications on a remote computer.
    .DESCRIPTION
        This function interrogates the remote registry for installed software products.
        It then returns an array of powershell objects that can be sorted and parsed.
        
        Optionally, you can provide a product name that will filter applications based on
        displayname before they are returned, thus reducing the typing needed to get specific results.
    .PARAMETER computer
        The name of the computer to retrieve a software list from.
    .PARAMETER product
        The partial name of a software application to search for.
