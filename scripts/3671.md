Use of export-csv -Append

```posh
Hi,

I've tried your excellent -Append feature for export-csv and it works good. I've only have a short question. 

Is it possible to make the append to new columns instead of rows? I'd like to combine two csv files as a part of an automation script and then I must get this to work.


Import-csv  C:\Visiolizer\CI.csv | Select-Object * | Export-Csv C:\Visiolizer\Relation.csv -Append

The above work with your source code imported to my $profile, but I'd like to append it to columns. Do you know of any solution?

Would be very thankful for a response

Regards
Erik
