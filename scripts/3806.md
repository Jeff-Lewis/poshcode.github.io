# Search Files by Date

### [download](3806.ps1) - [parent](3805.md)

Please:  If you download and like, please tweet it.

This project is in response to "Need PS script to search files by date accessed" script request: http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/site/requests/Need-PS-script-to-search-files-by-date-accessed-66042eaf?ShowSubmitLinkForm=False

This is a script that will export a csv file containing the names of files for files in a certain directory (including sub-directories) within a date range.  When ran, the script asks for the root directory, the from and to dates, and where to export the file to.
 

Enjoy!
