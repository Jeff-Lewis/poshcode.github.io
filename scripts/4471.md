# Read-HostMultiple

### [download](4471.ps1)

Reads multiple lines from the console, combining them into an array of strings. Based on the method in DOS/BATCH of
for /f tokens=* %i in ("more")
By default, send a Ctrl-Z on a new line to terminate, similar to the terminating method in DOS. Terminating character can be changed by parameter 2.
Useful for pasting a load of text in e.g. a list of User IDs (no need to save it to a file first) and performing something on each line

```posh
Function Read-HostMultiple {
## Dave Johnson 07/09/2013
## Allows Read-Host to gather multiple lines of input and return an array of the strings.
## Type paste input. When done, send the Termininating character on its own.
## Terminating character by default is Ctrl-Z to mimic DOS
## Parameters are Prompt to display at the top. Helpful to indicate the TerminatingChar
## if your end user isn't likely to be familiar with the context.
## TerminatingChar is character to send (on its own) to end the collection.
## Suggest using [Char]xx to set to maintain readability throughout various text editors
