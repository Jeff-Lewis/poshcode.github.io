# MailChimp 

### [download](3351.ps1)

A PoSh script to batch feed email address, firstname and lastname to the MailChimp API (MCAPI)

The script reads members from an AD group and fires them off to MCAPI to be added to the specified list, base functionality for removals is provided although there is a glitch with MCAPI's removesubscription method, if this ever gets resolved I'll update and repost.

The script requires 3 parameters, Your MailChimp API Key, List ID and an AD group to read from, this has been tested with 1500+ subscriptions with no issue, it's possible to batch these even further but I had no real need :)
