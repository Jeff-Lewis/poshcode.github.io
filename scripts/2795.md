description:    This is a very simple function that returns a DateTime time stamp.  I use it in scripts for noting times when actions occur like this Write-Host "$(Time-Stamp): Attempting to create directory.";  It's a lot shorter than writing out the whole thing.  You can also alias it to simplify the process: New-Alias -Name ts -Value Time-Stamp;.  This way I use Write-Host "$(ts): Attempting to create directory.";  It outputs: 2011.07.17 05:01:10: Attempting to create directory.  You can alter the value in the ToString to change the way the time stamp is formatted.
