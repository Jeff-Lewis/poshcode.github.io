#How to kill a process by username
#Originally created for a script (running under a sched task) that was not closing excel application after enumerating throught the excel file
#Powershell does not seem to close excel properly using the workbook.close function
#Note: could not kill the process when I included the extension... example notepad.exe has to be notepad for the $process variable
