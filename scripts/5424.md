Here is full description provided by the customer:
"
We have large number of Citrix / Terminal Services profiles sitting on Network Share. I need help writing powershell script that will do some cleanup such as deleting the contents of all temp folders locations for each user profile.  

just to be super clear: 

1. the script will run on a server that has "users profiles" folder mapped to it. 

2. the "User profiles" folder contains large number of folders. each folder represent (User profile) so the script should know that it needs to go inside each folder (User profile) first and then check if the following folder directories are empty, if they are not empty it will clean it up and provide the result in a log file. 

Here is list of path inside each user profile. 

\UPM_Profile\AppData\Local\Temp
\UPM_Profile\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files
\UPM_Profile\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache
\UPM_Profile\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Media Cache
\UPM_Profile\AppData\Local\MigWiz

Thank you

                        \AppData\Local\Temp
                        \AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files
                        \AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache
                        \AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Media Cache
                        \UPM_Profile\AppData\Local\MigWiz
               
                The script logs its work to Windows Log -> Application. You can use standard Log Viewer (

                The path to Users Profiles directory is hardcoded in the script and should be modified!
