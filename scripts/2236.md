# Test if file is writable

### [download](2236.ps1) - [parent](2235.md)

Function to test if a file is writable. Uses the .openwrite() method to test and returns a boolean.
Supports -verbose parameter and inline help.
Path can be provided as a string or as an object to the file.
Pipeline input is supported. e.g. $bar | get-IsWriteable
Just updated this to give it the name it should have had to start with...
