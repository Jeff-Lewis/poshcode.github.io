description:    Generic script for Citrix PVS and App-V to publish apps without the need for a management and database server for App-V.  Generic script doesn't need to be updated for every change or app so the image wont have to be opened and sealed every time.  The published app in the XenApp console passes the necessary information for each new published app, making it easy to add apps on the fly and not have to modify the PVS image.  This script should be not necessary if you have XenApp 7.8 or higher.
