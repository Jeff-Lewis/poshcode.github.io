# Automount new PSDrives

### [download](525.ps1)

This only works PowerShell v2.0 CTP2, and you’ll need to save it as AutoMount.psm1 in a directory under your documents folder like so (vista example):

%userprofile%\documents\windowspowershell\packages\automount\automount.psm1

You can then load it with the command:

ps> add-module automount

I have this in my profile.  You can temporarily disable automount with the function Disable-AutoMount and reenable it at anytime with Enable-AutoMount. The module also exposes four new events for you to consume yourself. You could, for example, hook your own script to run anytime a device is added and/or removed. This is what I do myself in the module. I hook a WMI event once then forward 1 of 4 possible new events depending on the type of WMI event that was raised. 

NOTE: this particular flavour of WMI query only works in Vista and Windows 2003 it appears. I’m looking into getting it working with 2000/XP also.

@@# this WMI is only available with Windows 2003 and Vista (not XP it appears).
