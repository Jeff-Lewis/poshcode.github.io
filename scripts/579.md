# Description: 	Create Events in Application log
# Date:			03-05-2007
# Author:		Stefan Stranger & Ken 
# Explanation:	If you only wish to write to the event log you must do two things. The first is to create or specify a Source. 
#				The second is to call the WriteEntry method. The source would be your application name, by default, 
#				if you create a source that is new then your log entry will be written to the Application Log. To WriteEntry method does the actual writing to the Event Log.
#				ev.WriteEntry(&#65533;My event text&#65533;, System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntryType.Information, myeventid)
# Changes:		Ken made changes in the Write-Eventlog function: 1) modified it so that you can log events in any Event Log using the Source to look up which log to use, 
#				added a check in to ask if the user wants to create the missing Source in the Application log rather than just creating it, 
#               never know when you will msispell a source ;) 3) Modified the question for description to also say or Params/Param[1].
