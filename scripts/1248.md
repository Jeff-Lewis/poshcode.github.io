# VMWare Quick Migration

### [download](1248.ps1) - [parent](1247.md) - children: [1249](1249.md)

Performs the functional equivalent of a Hyper-V Quick Migration by suspending a VM, moving it to a new host, and resuming it. This does not require vMotion licensing. It works by providing required VM objects via the pipeline or the second argument, and specifying the Destination host in the first argument, so you can use whatever query you want to build a list of VM's to send to the command.

#Name: VMWare Quick Migration Function
#Author: Justin Grote <jgrote NOSPAMAT enpointe DOT com>
#Credit: Inspired by Mike DiPetrillo's Quick Migration Script: http://www.mikedipetrillo.com/mikedvirtualization/2008/10/quick-migration-for-vmware-the-power-of-powershell.html
#Version: 0.1
#Last Revised: 31 July 2009
#
#Description: Performs the fucntional equivalent of a Hyper-V Quick Migration by suspending a VM, 
#	moving it to a new host, and resuming it. This does not require vMotion licensing.
#	it works by providing required VM objects via the pipeline or the second argument, 
#	and specifying the Destination host in the first argument.
#	The commeand accepts both text strings and VMHost objects for the VMHost Parameter
#

#Prerequisites:
#	Powershell v1
#	VMWare PowerCLI 4.0 (May work with earlier version but not tested)
#
#Instructions to Install: Save this script and import into your session with, for example, . C:\temp\quickmigrate.ps1
#	You can also include it in your PowerCLI profile to have it automatically included.
#Command Usage: get-vm MyTestVM | Quick-MigrateVM "MyTestHost2"
