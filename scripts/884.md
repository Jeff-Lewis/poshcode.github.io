It would really be sweet if I could get-netstat -sate CLOSE_WAIT

I have a server issue I'm trying to track down after it hangs upon a sudden plethora of CLOSE_WAIT s I plan to modify it to log or email every few minutes all the close_waits so I can try and narrow down the first client that seems to get there to help pinpoint.

Very helpful script though...  

```posh
$null, $null, $null, $null, $netstat = netstat -a -n -o
[regex]$regexTCP = '(?<Protocol>\S+)\s+(?<LocalAddress>\S+)\s+(?<RemoteAddress>\S+)\s+(?<State>\S+)\s+(?<PID>\S+)'
[regex]$regexUDP = '(?<Protocol>\S+)\s+(?<LocalAddress>\S+)\s+(?<RemoteAddress>\S+)\s+(?<PID>\S+)'
foreach ($net in $netstat)
{
    switch -regex ($net.Trim())
    {
        $regexTCP
        {			
            $process = "" | Select-Object Protocol, LocalAddress, RemoteAddress, State, PID, ProcessName
            $process.Protocol = $matches.Protocol
            $process.LocalAddress = $matches.LocalAddress
            $process.RemoteAddress = $matches.RemoteAddress
            $process.State = $matches.State
            $process.PID = $matches.PID
            $process.ProcessName = ( Get-Process -Id $matches.PID ).ProcessName
            $process
            continue
        }
        $regexUDP
        {
            $process = "" | Select-Object Protocol, LocalAddress, RemoteAddress, State, PID, ProcessName
            $process.Protocol = $matches.Protocol
            $process.LocalAddress = $matches.LocalAddress
            $process.PID = $matches.PID
	   $process.ProcessName = ( Get-Process -Id $matches.PID ).ProcessName
            $process
            continue
        }
    }
}
```
