If you have a medium to large size website, you can provide a Sitemap so that search engines intelligently index your site's content.

A Sitemap in it's simples form is an XML file containing a list of available URLs on your site. See sitemaps.org for more information on Sitemaps in general.

This script is intended as a starting point for generating a Sitemap for your site - since every website is different you will most likely need to customise it to make it work for you.

In it's present form, this script generates a list of static URLs based on the contents of an array and also a list of product / location / items from a text file. This can be expanded as necessary to suit your requirements.

## Write-Sitemap.ps1
##
## Generates a basic Sitemap for your website, based on a list of locations / products or whatever,
## (depending on your requirements). Can easily be extended to create more complex Sitemaps.
## 
## This uses XMLTextWriter and is based on the RSS creator script at 
## http`://pshscripts.blogspot.com/2008/12/write-rssstreamps1.html
##
## Note the URLs in this script have been escaped. You may have to remove the backticks.

## Sitemap format, as output by this script (see http`://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.php for more)

## <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
## <urlset xmlns="http`://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
##  <url>
##   <loc>http`://your.url/here/product1</loc>

##  <url>
