description:    Dear scripters,
the original script won't work, beacuse a ")" is missing in the param statement and the automatic $input variable is used as a parameter to the function but not in the Encoding.GetBytes method where an undefined parameter $str is encountered!
I would prefer to just convert strings into char arrays and return the byte code as hex chars and wrap it into a small advanced function that returns the hex chars joined by a seperator like ','
