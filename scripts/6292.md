description:    This script is for use with MDT. It was written in order to re-image OEM laptops with a clean OS and re-use the preinstalled Windows product key. The script will attempt to pull the OEM product key from WMI and, if available, use slmgr.vbs to install that product key. The same Windows version and edition must be used, otherwise this script will fail. If an OEM key is not found in WMI, the script attempts to determine the version of Windows and use slmgr.vbs to install the generic key for the corresponding version. I have only listed the more common versions of Windows.
