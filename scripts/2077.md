description:    # COMMENT: 
#	This script was created to manually scavenge DNS records for a given 
#   period. Specify the date/domain/DNS server/Subnet .  It will create log files for each subnet
#
#   v1.1 - Added Network Range to filter based on network range (good for 
#          doing one site/floor at a time)
#   v1.2 - Added the ability to do multiple ranges at the same time.
