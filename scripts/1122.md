description:    This script will recursively enumerate your entire “server” objects, if they all reside under an OU and get the service tag via WMI for each one of them excluding the VMWare guest servers.  This is good if you have a lot of servers and don't want to spend the time having to go to each one of them to manually get the information.

This script will recursively enumerate your entire “server” objects, if they all reside under an OU and get the service tag via WMI for each one of them excluding the VMWare guest servers.  This is good if you have a lot of servers and don't want to spend the time having to go to each one of them to manually get the information.

```posh
#You Need Quest AD Powershell Plugin
#You Need VMWare VI Toolkit

$Null = Connect-VIServer Your-VM-Server-Here;

$Servers = New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList

$Null = Get-QADComputer -SearchRoot 'your.domain.com/Path/To/Server/OU' |  Select-Object -property Name | Format-Table -HideTableHeaders| Out-String -Stream | ForEach-Object{$Servers.Add($_.ToString().ToUpper())}
$Null = Get-VM | Select-Object -property Name | Format-Table -HideTableHeaders | Out-String -Stream | ForEach-Object{$Servers.Remove($_.ToString().ToUpper())}


foreach ($Server in $Servers | Sort-Object )
{
	ServiceTag = (Get-WmiObject Win32_BIOS -comp ($Server.ToString().Split(' '))[0]).SerialNumber;
	$Result = New-Object -TypeName psobject;
	$Result | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "Server Name" ($Server.ToString().Split(' '))[0];
	$Result | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name "Service Tag" $ServiceTag;
	 
	Write-Output $Result;
	
	
}
