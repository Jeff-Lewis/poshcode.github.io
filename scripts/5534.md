Run the following from the Exchange 2010 shell and it will give you a semi-graphical view on the status of any open move requests:

```posh
$Requests = get-moverequest|get-moverequeststatistics

while ($TRUE) {
       $Requests | Foreach-Object {
              if ($_.status -eq "InProgress") {
                     Write-Host -foregroundcolor "Yellow" "Mailbox move for $($_.Displayname) is in progress and is $($_.PercentComplete)% complete"
              }
              elseif ($_.status -eq "Complete"){
                     Write-Host -ForegroundColor "Green" "Mailbox move for $($_.Displayname) is complete"
              }
              elseif ($_.status -eq "Queued"){
                     Write-Host -ForegroundColor "RED" "Mailbox move for $($_.Displayname) is still queued"
              }

       }
       Start-sleep -seconds 10
       Clear-Host
} 

```
