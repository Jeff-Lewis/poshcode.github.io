ping check using dotNet ping.  pieced together from existing examples on the web.  Had to use $erroractionpreference = "SilentlyContinue" to make it work on non-existing systems.
 

```posh
function check-ping {
$erroractionpreference = "SilentlyContinue"
$ping = new-object System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping
$rslt = $ping.send($args)
if ($rslt.status.tostring() –eq “Success”) {
        write-host $args + “ ping worked”
}
else {
        write-host $args + “ ping failed”
}
$ping = $null
}
```
