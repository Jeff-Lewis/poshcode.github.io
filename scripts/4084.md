This will parse through shares to delete the x.mpeg and autorun.inf file that gets created and un-hide the folders that are hidden all by the change up virus. You need to supply the shares in the form of \\server\share\  this can be created through the net view servername > txt file path and name. from there the list can be massaged into the \\servername\sharename\ format.

```posh
# This is to remove the Hidden folder attribute and delete the autorun.inf and x.mpeg due to changeup virus!
# 4-3-2013 John R Remillard
# You need the exact root folder path to unhide and delete the proper files and folders.
#$Pth = Read-Host "Enter full path to unhide"
$Lst = Get-Content c:\Shares.txt
foreach ($Pth in $Lst)
{
$File1 = Test-Path $Pth"autorun.inf"
if ($File1 -eq "True") 
{
 	$Pth | Out-File c:\changup_virus.txt -append
    Remove-item -Path $Pth"autorun.inf" -Force
	Remove-item -Path $Pth"x.mpeg" -Force
	get-childitem $pth -directory -hidden | foreach {$_.Attributes="Normal"}
}
}
