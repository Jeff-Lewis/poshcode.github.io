# Exchange07 Mbox Report

### [download](2084.ps1)

Power Shell 1 Script for Exchange 2007 mailbox statistics.

I use this script to get more detailed inbox information when people complain about not having enough inbox space.  It saves data into html tables and can be viewed using your web browser of choice.

```posh
#This script is designed to grab mailbox statistics for every user and give a more detailed
#level of output about mailbox statistics in .html format

param(
	[string] $SFileWDir
)

# If there is no optional argument then make a filename for it.
if (!$SFileWDir)
{
	Write-Host "You didn't specify a filename w/dir to save to so I'm going to just make one in this directory"
	Write-Host "Saving the file as GUReport-$date.html"

	# Generate the date var
	$date = get-date -Format MM-dd-yyyy

	# FOR TESTING PURPOSES, CHANGE METHOD ON THIS LATER
	$OUTFILE = "GUReport-$date.html"
}
else
{
	Write-Host "Saving file as $SFileWDir"
	$OUTFILE = $SFileWDir
}
	
# Gather the list of users with mailboxes to check
$UserList = get-user | Sort-Object $_.DisplayName | Where {$_.RecipientType -eq "UserMailbox"}

		# Generate the Folder Size in MB.  Note that I had to change the output to int in order for it to work
		$FolderSizeBytes = $_.FolderSize
		#Need to convert the string to int for it to be divisable.  
		#Remove any characters from the string as it's converted to int.
		[int]$FolderSizeBytesInt = [regex]::Replace($FolderSizeBytes, "B|K", "") #Most entries have a B at the end, some a K for some odd reason...
		[int]$FolderSize = $FolderSizeBytesInt / 1MB
