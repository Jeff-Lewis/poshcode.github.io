# script does not continue

### [download](2832.ps1)

Hello Halr9000,
I was using the script and see the continue statement but somehow it stops processing the next computer after it found a machine that is not pingable
Do you know how to make the script continue?

```posh
Process {
	# If the computer isn't pingable, move on to next in pipeline.
@@	if ( -not ( SelectAlive $_ ) ) { continue }
```
