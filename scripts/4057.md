description:    This powershell script can be used to reset alerts on a SharePoint site.  This may be necessary if scheduled alerts are arriving an hour early or late due to daylight savings time.  This script was inspired by: http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/877d2abd-fce9-4545-b223-7637936dd888 which while as a side effect will reset the alerts, however it does a lot more than restarting the alerts.




The Reset-Alerts function also has additional options to reset just a specific user's alerts.

This script was tested on SharePoint 2010, however this should still work with SharePoint 2013.


This script is supplied "As Is" without warranty.
