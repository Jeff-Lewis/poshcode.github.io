# MoveMailboxBySize

### [download](2029.ps1)

This script was developed to assist a customer with moving customizable batches of users, starting smallest mailboxes first in batches, and move them into datastores sorted by last name. This script is modular and can be extended to different filtering mechanisms, or a different datastore sorting criteria.

```posh
### VARIABLES ###

#Stop the script if an error ever occurs
$ErrorActionPreference = "stop"

#Base Directory
$BaseDir="C:\Scripts"

#Place for Migration Reports
$ReportFileDir="C:\Scripts\Logs"

#Exclusion List of Mailboxes to Not Move. This should be a return-separated list of mailbox display names to avoid.
$ExclusionListFile="$BaseDir\ExcludedMailboxes.txt"

#Special Mailboxes. These are mailboxes that should be completely exempt, including errorChecking to see if they exist, such as non-standard system mailboxes or others that may cause problems with migration.
$SpecialMailboxes="$BaseDir\SpecialMailboxes.txt"

#Excluded 2003 Hosts not to Scan for Mailboxes
$ExcludedHosts="$BaseDir\ExcludedHosts.txt"

#Number of Mailboxes to Move in this Batch 
$MailboxCount = 10000

#Output if a user is excluded by the Exclusion List
$ShowExclusions=$true

#Migrate for real. Only do a "what-if" evaluation if false.
$MigrateMailboxes = $false

### Functions ###

#Select-MigrateMailboxDatabase
#***READ ME*** REPLACE THE REGEX AND Mailbox Database Names as appropriate.
