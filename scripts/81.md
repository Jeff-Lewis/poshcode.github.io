# Select-Random v2.0

### [download](81.ps1) - [parent](60.md) - children: [83](83.md)

Select a user-defined number of random elements from the collection ... which can be passed as a parameter or input via the pipeline. An improvement over http://www.powershellcentral.com/scripts/60 which allows you to select more than one item, and doesn't copy the full collection into RAM.

### <Description>
### Selects a random element from the collection either passed as a parameter or input via the pipeline.
### If the collection is passed in as an argument, we simply pick a random number between 0 and count-1
### for each element you want to return, but when processing pipeline input we want to keep memory use 
### to a minimum, so we use a "reservoir sampling" algorithm[1].
###
### [1] http://gregable.com/2007/10/reservoir-sampling.html
###
### The script stores $count elements (the eventual result) at all times. It continues processing 
### elements until it reaches the end of the input. For each input element $n (the count of the inputs 
### so far) there is a $count/$n chance that it becomes part of the result.
### * For each previously selected element, there is a $count/($n-1) chance of it being selected 
### * For the ones selected, there's a ($count/$n * 1/$count = 1/$n) chance of it being replaced, so a 
###   ($n-1)/$n chance of it remaining ... thus, it's cumulative probability of being among the selected
###   elements after the nth input is processed is $count/($n-1) * ($n-1)/$n = $count/$n, as it should be.
