# Get-Netstat 1,3

### [download](2694.ps1) - [parent](2398.md)

This will perform a basic netstat.exe command and "objectize" its output.  

v0.9	Initial Build - Hal
V1.0	Added support for UDP, and processname -Glenn
v1.1	Expanded [regex] statements to encompass IPV4/IPV6/ports. -Glenn
v1.2    Changed the process name lookup to make script a bit faster -Ivan
v1.3	Simplified RegEx to make IPv6 work.  Had issues in PowerGUI until $process was initialized in the For loop

```posh
$null, $null, $null, $null, $netstat = netstat -a -n -o
$ps = Get-Process
[regex]$regexTCP = '(?<Protocol>\S+)\s+(?<LAddress>\S+):(?<LPort>\S+)\s+(?<RAddress>\S+):(?<RPort>\S+)\s+(?<State>\S+)\s+(?<PID>\S+)'
[regex]$regexUDP = '(?<Protocol>\S+)\s+(?<LAddress>\S+):(?<LPort>\S+)\s+(?<RAddress>\S+):(?<RPort>\S+)\s+(?<PID>\S+)'

[psobject]$process = "" | Select-Object Protocol, LocalAddress, Localport, RemoteAddress, Remoteport, State, PID, ProcessName

foreach ($net in $netstat)
{
    switch -regex ($net.Trim())
    {
        $regexTCP
        {      
	   $process = "" | Select-Object Protocol, LocalAddress, Localport, RemoteAddress, Remoteport, State, PID, ProcessName
            $process.Protocol = $matches.Protocol
            $process.LocalAddress = $matches.LAddress
            $process.Localport = $matches.LPort
            $process.RemoteAddress = $matches.RAddress
            $process.Remoteport = $matches.RPort
            $process.State = $matches.State
            $process.PID = $matches.PID
            $process.ProcessName = ( $ps | Where-Object {$_.Id -eq $matches.PID} ).ProcessName
	   $process
	   continue
        }
        $regexUDP
        {         
	   $process = "" | Select-Object Protocol, LocalAddress, Localport, RemoteAddress, Remoteport, State, PID, ProcessName
            $process.Protocol = $matches.Protocol
            $process.LocalAddress = $matches.LAddress
            $process.Localport = $matches.LPort
            $process.RemoteAddress = $matches.RAddress
            $process.Remoteport = $matches.RPort
            $process.State = $matches.State
            $process.PID = $matches.PID
            $process.ProcessName = ( $ps | Where-Object {$_.Id -eq $matches.PID} ).ProcessName
	   $process
	   continue
        }
    }
}
