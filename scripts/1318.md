Why to use a FileselectionBox to save your fresh files from ISE, don't you know your file system? OK perhaps an encoding parameter would be fine, but please don't default it to ASCII.

function Save-CurrentFile ($path)
{
    $psISE.CurrentFile.SaveAs($path)
    $psISE.CurrentFile.Save([Text.Encoding]::default)

}

# Save-CurrentFile '.\Save-CurrentFile.ps1'
