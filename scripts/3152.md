### [download](3152.ps1) - [parent](3140.md) - children: [3153](3153.md)

Quick and simple, send an email to AD accounts expiring before a specified date.  The $body is specific to my org needs, but simply customize this to suit.  Give values to $smtp,$from,$subject etc and away you go.

```posh
Function GetMsgBody {
	Write-Output @"
		<p>Dear $name,</p>
		Your ABC network account is about to expire.<br/>
		Please email helpdesk@abc.com or simply hit 'reply', and include the following details to have your account extended.<br/>
		<br/>
		Your name:<br/>
		The department you currently volunteer in:<br/>
		The staff supervisor's name you currently report to:<br/>
		The current status of your involvement with ABC (Staff/Student/Volunteer):<br/>
		<br/>
		Kind Regards,<br/>
		ABC IT Services
"@
}

Get-QADUser -AccountExpiresBefore "31/01/2012" -Enabled -SizeLimit 0 | ForEach-Object {
