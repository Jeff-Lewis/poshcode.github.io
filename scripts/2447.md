# ExecutePowerShell.cmd

### [download](2447.txt)"

This is a *batch* file ... with a PowerShell script inside.  It's my answer to all those "compile your .ps1" solutions that are floating around. Why would you do that, when PowerShell still has to be installed?

In any case, just replace the last two lines of the file with ... whatever script you want to execute, and hand it out as a .cmd batch file.  People can double-click it and it should "just work"

Note that it runs with ExecutionPolicy unrestricted and -NoProfile to make sure the environment is the same on everyone's PC...

```text
:: <#
copy %0 %0.ps1
PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -NoProfile -Command "$ErrorActionPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'; . %0.ps1; Remove-Item %0.ps1"
exit
:: #>
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue'

### Your PowerShell script goes below here.
### I've put a couple of lines as an example ...
ls | sort length -desc | select -first 5 | ft
ps | sort ws -desc | select -first 10 | ft

```
