description:    This script estimates how long an (additional) automotive investment will take to pay itself off.

It includes Future Value calcuations assuming you are planning on otherwise going to ivnest the extra money. 

This is useful when decyphering between buying a new car, motorcycle or MPG enhancing car part.

For example, it answers the following question: "I want to buy the hybrid version of a car, but it costs me 5000 extra. How long will it take before that 5000 dollars pays itself off in gas savings? How long if i invested the 5000 in a CD at 1%?"
