# Get-TranscriptFilePath

### [download](2423.ps1)

Get the name of the current (or last) transcription file used in the current session. Requires powershell v2.0. Some things to note: 
 
- it's an empty string if you have not yet used transcription in the current session
- if transcribing, it contains the current transcription file path
- if you have previously transcribed and now stopped, it does not revert to an empty string
 
On this last point, this means a non-empty transcript file path does not mean you are currently transcribing.

```posh
#requires -version 2.0

function Get-TranscriptFilePath {
    try {
      $externalHost = $host.gettype().getproperty("ExternalHost",
        [reflection.bindingflags]"nonpublic,instance").getvalue($host, @())
      $externalhost.gettype().getfield("transcriptFileName", "nonpublic,instance").getvalue($externalhost)
    } catch {
      write-warning "This host does not support transcription."
    }
}
```
