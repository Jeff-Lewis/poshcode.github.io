description:    If you download or use, please tweet it or email me.  Thanks!

This project is in response to "script to monitor a service on a server" script request:  http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/site/requests/script-to-monitor-a-service-on-a-server-636b6a0d?ShowSubmitLinkForm=False

This script checks the status for a defiled service for a group of servers, listed in the serverList.txt file.  In this case the CPSVS service.  However this can be changed to the name of the service you want to check.  It exports the status of the service for each server.  After that, it sends the output file as an attachment in an email to a defined group of addresses.

 

To use this script your will need to make some changes in the scritp:

Create Server list and save to serverList.txt file
Adjust the import location of the serverList.txt file on Line 15 
Change the service - to the service you want to check
Adjust the output location of the ServerServiceStatus.csv file on line 27
Adjust the email address on Line 32.
To use more than one email address, separtate with a comma:
recipient1@domain.com, recipient2@domain.com
Adjust the SmtpServer address on Line 32
 

I hope you find this useful!  Comments and suggestions are welcome!
