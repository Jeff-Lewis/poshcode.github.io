description:    Requires Powershell 2.0 & the grouppolicy module.
Using the configuration block in the script you can define where to back GPOs up to, how often to backup everything and how often to backup only what has changed since the last good backup.  Schedule the script to automatically run every so often depending on your needs and you should have a nice GPO backup solution.
