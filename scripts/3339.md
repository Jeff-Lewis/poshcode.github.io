# Pause

### [download](3339.ps1)

Function was originally posted by the PowerShell Team on 2007/02/25 @ http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2007/02/25/pause.aspx
This function will simulate the 'Pause' feature of CMD.exe.

```posh
function Pause ($Message = "Press any key to continue...")
{
	Write-Host -NoNewline $Message
	$null = $Host.UI.RawUI.ReadKey("NoEcho,IncludeKeyDown")
	Write-Host ""
}
```
