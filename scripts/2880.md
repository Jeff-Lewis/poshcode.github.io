# Get-LockoutInfo

### [download](2880.ps1)

Used to find invalid login/lockout events.  Should be run on each domain controller with the output being reviewed after each run.  The output report should contain events pertaining to invalid login attempts or lockout events.  By reviewing the report, you should be able to determine the system where the invalid attempt is originating.

# Find Lockout Events                                 #
#                                                     #
# Pre-Requisites: Domain Admin Rights, Writeable      #
# C:\temp directory on both the local machine and     #
# the domain controllers.                             #
#                                                     #
# Summary:  Script will prompt for AD username,       #
# the name of the domain controller, and the name     #
# of the domain.  A WMI call will initiate a backup   #
# of the security event log on the domain controller. #
# That backup copy will be moved to the local machine #
# where it is parsed for specific events filtered by  #
# user and/or event.  Output is written to a text file#
# in the local c:\temp directory.  Lastly, the local  #
# copy of the security log is deleted if possible as  #
# a cleanup measure.                                  #
#                                                     #
# Note:  Run on every domain controller and review    #
#        output after each run.                       #
#                                                     #
#                                                     # 
#                                                     #
#                                                     #
