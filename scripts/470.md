These functions allow one to easily save network credentials to disk in a relatively secure manner.  The resulting on-disk credential file can only [1] be decrypted by the same user account which performed the encryption.  For more details, see the help files for ConvertFrom-SecureString and ConvertTo-SecureString as well as MSDN pages about Windows Data Protection API.

[1]: So far as I know today.  Next week I'm sure a script kiddie will break it.

# Usage:	Export-PSCredential [-Credential <PSCredential object>] [-Path <file to export>]
#
#			If Credential is not specififed, user is prompted by Get-Credential cmdlet.
#			If not specififed, Path is "./credentials.enc.xml".
#			Output: FileInfo object referring to saved credentials
#
#			Import-PSCredential [-Path <file to import>]
#
#			If not specififed, Path is "./credentials.enc.xml".
#			Output: PSCredential object
