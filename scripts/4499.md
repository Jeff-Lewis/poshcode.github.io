This script will help you replace old VMware portgroups with new ones and switch all VMs over to these new port groups with no downtown or network traffic loss. Originally written to take an environment with nonsensical, non-standardized port group naming to a proper standard. This required supporting files as are listed in the script description. There are portions that need to be filled out with relevant info to your environment, these are also outlined in the comments.

#========================================================================

#NOTES: For each run, you will be prompted to make selections for the $vcenter and $cluster variables
# 		$vSwitch names are pulled from a pre-populated table on line 30, based on cluster selection
# 		COMPARISON LISTS BEGINNING ON LINE 74 compares old groups to corresponding new group based on cluster selection (should match those in "portgroups.csv" and "oldgroups.txt")
#     	        Fill out "portgroups.csv" with the names and vLANs of all new portgroups that need to be created
# 		Fill out "oldgroups.txt" with the names of all the defunct portgroup names that need to be changed (these lists will be used later to delete empty portgroups)
# 		"vm_portgroup_log.txt" contains all information regarding VMs that failed ping tests after portgroup changes
# 		"vm_portgroup_previousconfig.txt" lists all VM's previous portgroup configs before changes are made for rollback
