title:          Update User Profiles
date:           2014-08-13 23:24:33
description:    This is an update to the original script from TheMoblin http://poshcode.org/4651 for larger implementations for larger AD infrastructure. I have help with this from Don and Mike at Powershell.org forums.
This allows for only the users that need to be updated to be actioned, and also allows for targetting to a specific OU. This was updated to cope with a rather flat OU structure with thousands of user objects in each OU when only a few hundred may need updating

# Update User Profiles

This is an update to the original script from TheMoblin http://poshcode.org/4651 for larger implementations for larger AD infrastructure. I have help with this from Don and Mike at Powershell.org forums.
This allows for only the users that need to be updated to be actioned, and also allows for targetting to a specific OU. This was updated to cope with a rather flat OU structure with thousands of user objects in each OU when only a few hundred may need updating


```posh
$OldServer = 'OldServer'
$NewServer = 'NewServer'
 
Import-Module ActiveDirectory
Get-ADUser -Filter "Enabled -eq 'true' -and HomeDirectory -like '*$OldServer*' -or ProfilePath -like '*$OldServer*'" -SearchBase "OU=xx,DC=xx,DC=xx,DC=xx" -Properties HomeDirectory, ProfilePath |
ForEach-Object {
    if ($_.HomeDirectory -like "*$OldServer*") {
        Set-ADUser -Identity $_.DistinguishedName -HomeDirectory $($_.HomeDirectory -replace $OldServer, $NewServer)
    }
    if ($_.ProfilePath -like "*$OldServer*") {
        Set-ADUser -Identity $_.DistinguishedName -ProfilePath $($_.ProfilePath -replace $OldServer, $NewServer)
    }
}
