# User Lookup Script

### [download](5568.ps1) - [parent](5567.md)

Mass User lookup Script to query user account name / UID and resolve a user's first last name created by Morne Loubser. This simple light-weight script can resolve as many usernames as you'd like to in one go. There aren't any sources that performs this function on the net, so this one is a definite keeper. The first of it's kind to date to make it's way onto the web. Can be used by both noobies and professional scripters.

HOW IT WORKS:
Simply populate the users.csv file with a list of usernames and let the script do the rest for you. It will dump all resolved details to the users_out.csv file as seen in the code. 

Enjoy!

Script reads from list and dumps to a new list. Couldn't find a sample/template online for this so I wrote this code. Feel free to share.
