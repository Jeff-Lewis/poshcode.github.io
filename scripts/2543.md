Groups by a set of properties, but rather than return a string as the "name" of the group, teturns one of the original objects with separate properties for each property used to group, and optionally adds _count and _details properties which are the original Count and Group properties returned from group-object.

```posh
function Group-ByObject {
#.Synopsis
# Groups by a set of properties, returning objects
#.Description
# A wrapper for the built-in Group-Object cmdlet which returns one of the original objects (with separate properties for each property used to group) rather than a simple string representation as the "name" of the group. Optionally adds _count and _details properties which are the original Count and Group properties returned from group-object
#.Example
# Get-Process svchost | Group-ByObject Name, BasePriority -Count
#
# Groups Service Hosts by their BasePriority
#
#.Parameter InputObject
# The input objects are the items to be grouped
#.Parameter Property
# One or more properties to group on
#.Parameter Details
# One or more properties to collect as an array on the output
#.Parameters Group
# If set, forces all of the grouped items to be included in the _group property
#.Parameters Count
# If set, shows a count of all the grouped items on each group as the _count property
