# Get Time Between Dates

### [download](6889.ps1) - [parent](6887.md)

Provide a begin and end time frame (mm dd yyyy) and this will calculate the years, months and days between the two dates.  This is NOT 100% accurate but it was close enough for what I was trying to do.  Someone with better math skills should be able to improve the accuracy.

```posh
Get-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online | Where {$_.PackageName -notlike “*store*” -and $_.PackageName -notlike “*calc*”} | Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online
Get-AppxPackage | Where {$_.PackageFullName -notlike “*store*” -and $_.PackageFullName -notlike “*calc*”} | Remove-AppxPackage
```
