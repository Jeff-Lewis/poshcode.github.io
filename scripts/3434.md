# Pivot-Object

### [download](3434.ps1) - [parent](885.md)

Takes a series of objects (like the converted input from csv) where there are a _series of objects (rows) that actually define the same object_, and there is (at least) one property which is a unique identifier (and appears on each object), and there are _two properties which are a *name and value pair* defining additional properties_ ... and outputs new objects which merge the objects and add the name-value pairs as new properties.

```posh
#.Synopsis
#   Pivot multiple objects which are normalized with properties that are name, value pairs.
#.Description
#  Takes a series of objects where there are multiple rows to represent each object, with a pair of columns with the name and value of an additional property, and outputs new objects which have those new properties on them.
#.Example
#  Import-CSV data.csv | Pivot-Objects SamAccountName Attribute Value
#
#  Imports csv data containing multiple rows per-record such that a pair of columns named "Attribute" and "Value" are actually different in each row, and contain a name and value pair for attributes you want to add to the output objects.
#.Example
# @"
#   ID,    Attribute,     Value,       SamAccountName
#     ,    HoursPerWeek,  40,          J8329029
#     ,    LastDay,       20 Feb 2010, J8329029
#   12276, Job,           Sw Eng,      J8329029
#   2479,  HoursPerWeek,  35,          X5969731
#   2479,  LastDay,       20 Feb 2009, X5969731
#   2479,  Job,           Sr. SW Eng,  X5969731
#   2479,  Rate,          40,          X5969731
#   2479,  Bonus,         10000,       X5969731
# "@.Split("`n") | ConvertFrom-Csv | Pivot-Object -Group SamAccountName -Name Attribute -Value Value -Jagged
#   
#  This provides a full example, with data, and demonstrates how -Jagged works:
#  * Without -Jagged, you get two objects which each have the same properties. 
#  * With Jagged, only one one of the object output will have the Rate and Bonus properties, because there's values for the J8329029 user.
