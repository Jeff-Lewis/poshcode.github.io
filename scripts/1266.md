Placed in my profile, this snippet of code starts a dated transcript file each time I open a PowerShell console.  My prompts are also date/time so I have a good record of what I did and when.

```posh
# Create the transcript file and start the transcript
new-item -path ([Environment]::GetFolderPath('MyDocuments')) -name "PowerShell_Transcripts" -type directory -ea "silentlycontinue"
$transcriptFolder = [Environment]::GetFolderPath('MyDocuments') + "\PowerShell_Transcripts\"
$filedate = get-date -format yyyyMMdd.hhmmss
$transcriptfile = $transcriptFolder + $filedate + ".log"
start-transcript $transcriptfile -noClobber -append
```
