<#
	.SYNOPSIS
		Returns information about the Processor via WMI. 

	.DESCRIPTION
		Information about the processor is returned using the Win32_Processor WMI class. 

		You can provide a single computer/server name or supply an array/list.

	.PARAMETER  Computers
		Single computer name, list of computers or .txt file containing a list of computers.

	.EXAMPLE
		.\Get-ProcessorInventory.ps1 -Computers (Get-Content C:\ComputerList.txt)

	.EXAMPLE
		.\Get-ProcessorInventory.ps1 -Computers Test-Server.company.com

	.EXAMPLE
		.\Get-ProcessorInventory.ps1 -Computers SERVER1.company.com,SERVER2.company.com | Format-Table -AutoSize

	.EXAMPLE
		.\Get-ProcessorInventory.ps1 -Computers SERVER1.company.com,SERVER2.company.com | Export-Csv C:\ProcInv.csv -NoTypeInformation

	.INPUTS
		System.String

	.OUTPUTS
		Selected.System.Management.ManagementObject
