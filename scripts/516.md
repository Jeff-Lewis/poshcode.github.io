A script for checking how many times a printerque has been used the last X month(s)

```posh
#Printer Statistic checking script by Henrik Pedersen Åmark

#This script is used to check how many times all printerques on the selected server has been used the latest X months
#First it gets all the events from the remote server's eventlog that are of ID 10 (successful print) and of the type "Print".
#Then it checks for the timestamps and filter away those that are older then X months.
#After the sorting it tries to match the printerque name against the message from the fort log line, if match it adds 1 to a counter and then take next line.
#If it doesnt match, it head to the next line.
#It will also write the statistics to a file.
#You will need admin rights to use this script
#
#Get todays date for creating filenames later
$date = Get-Date -UFormat %Y%m%d

#Finding out what host to check logs from
Write-Host "What server do you want to get the eventlog from?"
$hostname = Read-Host

#Get Eventlog from a remote host
$events = gwmi -ComputerName $hostname -query "select * from win32_ntlogevent where logfile='system' and eventcode='10' and sourcename='print'" | Select-Object EventCode, Timegenerated, Message | sort Timegenerated

#Making a variable for the printerports
$printerports = gwmi -computername $hostname Win32_Printer | Select-Object Portname, name

#Converting newest logtimes to DateTime
$newest = [System.Management.ManagementDateTimeConverter]::ToDateTime($events[0].TimeGenerated)
Write-Host "Oldest logentry is from:" $newest

Write-Host "How many months back do you want to check?"
$months = Read-Host

#Checks is the path where the files gonna be added exists, it it dont, it creates it

		$quecounter = 0
		
		#Looping through each line and checking for how old the events are and if they match the current printerquename
		foreach ($line in $events)
