Get-MyDomain retrieves the current IP of the user (Or, the first if there are multiple active cards) then performs a DNS lookup to retrieve the domain. If it is unable to reverse it, it displays Unknown:<IP>
Just a simple little function, useful for location based scripts.

```posh
Function Get-MyDomain() {

$IP = ((Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration -Filter IPEnabled=TRUE -ComputerName . | Select-Object -Property IPAddress -First 1).IPAddress[0])
  trap {
    return "Unknown:$($IP)"
	}
return [System.Net.DNS]::GetHostByAddress($IP).HostName
}
