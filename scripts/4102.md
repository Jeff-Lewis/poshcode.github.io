### [download](4102.ps1) [parent](1121.md) [4103](4103.md)

Syncs the system time with that of a remote time server.  Uses NetCmdlets.

```posh
function sync-time(
[string] $server = "clock.psu.edu",
[int] $port = 37)
{
  $servertime = get-time -server $server -port $port -set
  #leave off -set to just check the remote time
  write-host "Server time:" $servertime 
  write-host "Local time :" $(date)
}
```
