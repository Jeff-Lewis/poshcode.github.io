    DHCP Backups Powershell Script
    v1.1
    2012-06-04
    By VulcanX
 
    .SYNOPSIS
        This script will automate the backup of DHCP Databases and copy
        them into a DFS Store at the following link:
        \\domain.com\DHCP
        Each location has a seperate folder and once the backup
        completes a mail sent out if any errors occur.
        ***NB*** : This can only be run in AD Environments where there is 1 DHCP Server per site
    
    .USAGE & REQUIREMENTS
        1. Open Powershell (Start->Run->Powershell.exe) from the DHCP Server
        2. cd %ScriptLocation%
        3. .\DHCPBackup_v1.1
          
    .SCHEDULED TASK CONFIGURATION
        If you have your ExecutionPolicy set to RemoteSigned you will need to run the file with the
        following, to execute it from a UNC Path unless you sign it yourself.
            powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "\\domain.com\DHCP\DHCPBackup_v1.1.ps1"
       
     
***RECOVERY***

    Please use the following when recovering a failed DHCP Server/Scope:
    OPTION A:
    netsh dhcp server import "\\domain.com\DHCP\$SiteName\$Date\NetshExport" all
   
    DID NOT WORK IN TESTING!
    OPTION B:
    netsh exec "\\domain.com\DHCP\$SiteName\$Date\Dump.cfg"
       
    First and foremost always try use OPTION A as this will be able to run on any DHCP Server. OPTION B is a last resort
    if OPTION A didnt work.
    ***NB*** : OPTION B can only be run on the same server as what it was dumped from.
       
    .CHANGELOG
       
    v1.1 -  Changed the names in the DHCP DFS Share to reflect the site names
            When selecting which share location, it is based on which site the server is in
            Found a way to run the script from the DFS DHCP repository
            Script now uses dynamic methods allowing it to be more versatile
