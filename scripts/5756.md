# Start-ScriptThreading

Ever wanted to start some threads on a block of code but hated the headache of creating, watching, and collecting job data? This is my attempt to put a bandaid on that issue.
There are some assumptions made in this function, such as assuming you are threading to talk to a bunch of computers. Also assuming you only have one parameter to pass into your custom scriptblock, as well as assuming that the computer is a parameter for your scriptblock.

I hope you enjoy this nugget as I return to my retirement on Gallifrey...

```posh
function Start-ScriptThreading{
<#   
.SYNOPSIS
   
    Runs a scriptblock against multiple computers simultaneously 

.DESCRIPTION
 
    The ThreadedFunction function takes an array (usually a list of computers) and a scriptblock. The scriptblock will be run against
    each item in the array expecting each item of the array to also be a parameter expected in the scriptblock. 

.PARAMETER arComputers
 
    List of computers to run scriptblock against. 

.PARAMETER ScriptBlock
 
    Block of script to run against list from parameter -Computers   

.PARAMETER maxThreads
 
    Maximum number of threads to run at a time  

.PARAMETER SleepTimer
 
    Time to wait between loops. This is a spacing timer to prevent the main loop from hogging cpu time. 
    A smaller number may create and check for jobs faster.
    A large number will allow the separate threads more cpu time.  
    Any longer than 1000 milliseconds may render the progress indicator incorectly.
    (default is 500 milliseconds)   

.PARAMETER MaxWaitAtEnd

    Sets a timeout for threads before killing jobs. This timer is started after the last thread is created.
    (default is 180 seconds)

    To load this function into the current shell for use, or to use this file seperate from your main script,
 
    dot-source as follows '. .\ThreadedFunction.ps1'    

.EXAMPLE
   
    ThreadedScript -Computers 'server01', 'server02' -ScriptBlock {ping $Computer}

    The command 'ping' is threaded and ran against both server01 and server02. Declaring $Computer is required as is.

.EXAMPLE
   
    'server01', 'server02' | ThreadedScript -ScriptBlock {Get-WMIObject win32_computersystem -ComputerName $Computer}
 
    Pipes the array as Computers and gets the Win32_ComputerSystem WMI object from server01 and server02 simultaneously.   

.INPUTS

    System.String. Function will accept an array of strings and assume each as a parameter for the provided scriptblock.

.OUTPUTS

    System.Object. All returned data from each iteration that the scriptblock may create is returned as a single array.
