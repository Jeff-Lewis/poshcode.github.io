# Remove Special Char

### [download](3216.ps1)

This will recursively remove non-alphanumeric\decimal (via regex) characters from all folder and filenames. The decimals are left in tact for file extensions.

To replace the characters with another, modify the empty ' ') } section with your wanted word/char.

Please use -whatif for testing.

```posh
gci 'c:\test\' -Recurse | % { Rename-Item $_.FullName $($_.Name -replace
	'[^\w\.]','') }
```
