# Get-RecentLogons

### [download](3722.ps1)

This script allows you to pull the users who have logged into their domain account in the past “x” amount of days.  This is useful when you are trying to migrate users off a certain domain.  This script requires the Quest ActiveRoles PS Snapin.

```posh
Add-PSSnapin -Name Quest.ActiveRoles.ADManagement -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Location of the CSV file created. 
$fileLocation = "C:\temp\logon.csv"

# Get the Current Date 
$CURRENTDATE=GET-DATE

# Number of days to check
$COMPAREDATE = $CURRENTDATE.AddDays(-30)

# Your AD Domain
$server = "ad.domain.com"

Get-QADUser -Service $server -SizeLimit 0 |where {$_.LastLogon -gt $COMPAREDATE }| select lastlogon,lastname,firstname,logonname,whencreated,description |Export-Csv $fileLocation


```
