# Enquote-CmdlineArgument

### [download](4974.ps1)

This filter takes an arbitrary string, and escapes it for use as a single direct cmdline argument to a "traditional" program.

```posh
Filter Enquote-CmdlineArgument #Escapes according to CmdlineToArgvW's rules
{
    '"{0}"' -f $($($_ -replace '(\x5C*)$', '$1$1') -replace '(\x5C*)(\x22)', '$1$1\"')
}

<# In human terms, these are the steps it takes:
    * Double all terminal backslashes
    * Replace all double-quotes with a backslash followed by a double-quote, AND double any original preceding backslashes
    * Enclose the whole thing between a pair of double-quotes
