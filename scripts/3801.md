# Email Forwarding - O365

### [download](3801.ps1)

Script for forwarding and unforwarding email in Office 365. This script makes doing the tasks easier, without having to use OWA.  It saves time by not have to go into OWA to forward an email, when I get the request.  I'm new at PowerShell (taking my first class next week), so I know there might be better ways of doing this.  However, this works for me and I think it I did pretty good for just starting out.
