description:    A wrapper for Get-ChildItem with color highlighting for different file types.  I was thinking of the Linux 'ls --color', but didn't bother to match up colors or anything.  TODO: I should probably update it to precompile the regexes at the top so that they aren't compiled for each item returned by Get-ChildItem, and the ability to sort by type would be nice.  Note: you will have to remove the documentation at the beginning of the function if you want to use it with versions prior to v2.0 CTP3.
