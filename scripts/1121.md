# Sync-Time

### [download](1121.ps1) - children: [4102](4102.md), [4101](4101.md)

Syncs the system time with that of a remote time server.  Uses NetCmdlets.

```posh
function sync-time(
[string] $server = "clock.psu.edu",
[int] $port = 37)
{
  $servertime = get-time -server $server -port $port -set
  #leave off -set to just check the remote time
  write-host "Server time:" $servertime 
  write-host "Local time :" $(date)
}


```
