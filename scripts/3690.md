This is a script to remove empty folders from a drive. I used it when i had to clear up a shared drive from a former company.
Please let me know if you know a way i can improve it.

```posh
$Drive = Read-Host "Path to Folders"
Write-Host "This will delete all empty folders in this directory!"
$a = Get-ChildItem $drive -recurse | Where-Object {$_.PSIsContainer -eq $True}
$a | Where-Object {$_.GetFiles().Count -lt 1} | Select-Object FullName | ForEach-Object {remove-item $_.fullname -recurse} 
Write-Host "All Done!"
```
