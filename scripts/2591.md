# Get-DistanceOnEarth

### [download](2591.ps1)

Uses the Haversine equation (you know you LOVE spherical geometry) to calculate distance between two points on the earth.
The value of $R is set to the radius of the earth in miles; swap out comments to calculate in km.

This function works especially well with output from a modified version of Jason Hofferle's Google Geocoding script:

.SYNOPSIS
  Calculates distance between points on the Earth.
.DESCRIPTION
  Implementation of the Haversine equation to calculate distance over the surface of a sphere.
.INPUTTYPE
  Pipeline object with the following parameters: LATITUDE1 LONGITUDE1 LATITUDE2 LONGITUDE2

    Begin
    {
        $toRad = 0.0174532925 # radians in 1 degree

        #$R = 6378.1  # approx. radius of earth in km
