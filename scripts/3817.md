When moving very large mailboxes, the connection can time out.
Change the setting for TCPIP KeepAliveTime on a server or several servers.

<#
       .SYNOPSIS
              Change the setting for TCPIP KeepAliveTime on a server or several
              servers.
      
       .DESCRIPTION
              Change the setting for TCPIP KeepAliveTime on a server or several
              servers.
             
              When moving mailboxes with large number of folders or very large number
              of items it can take a very long time to enumerate the items. Sometimes
              it takes over 2 hours and the connection times out.
             
              We set the TCOPIP KeepAliveTime to it's max for the move or we reset
              it back to normal after a move is complete.
      
       .PARAMETER Name
              A collection of servers to set, reset, or read the KeepAliveTime
              registry setting.
             
       .PARAMETER KeepAliveTime
              The value to set KeepAliveTime. (A decimal number can be used.)
             
              Default is '0x000dbba0' - 15 Minutes
             
              0x000dbba0 ( 900000 decimal) 15 mnutes
              0x006ddd00 (7200000 decimal) is the installed default setting of 2 hours
             
             
       .PARAMETER ReadOnly
              Read the KeepAliveTime setting for each server in the collection of
              Servers
	      (should be a "get" but I am too lazy to write another script.)
 
       .PARAMETER Hours
              Set the collection of servers to TCPIP KeepAliveTime of <N> hours.
             
 
       .PARAMETER Max
              Set the collection of servers to the maximum TCPIP KeepAliveTime setting.
              Defined as 0xffffffff - essentially "Forever"
                          
       .EXAMPLE
              $Servers = Get-MailboxServer | ?{$_.AdminDisplayVersion -match "^Version 14"}
              Set-KeepAliveTime -Name $Servers
             
              Sets the KeepAliveTime on all the Mailbox servers to the Default setting.
             
       .EXAMPLE
              $servers = get-mailboxserver | ?{$_.AdminDisplayVersion -match "^Version 14"}
              Set-KeepAliveTime -Name $Servers -Max
             
              Sets the KeepAliveTime on all the Mailbox servers to the Maximum setting.
             
       .EXAMPLE
              $servers = Get-ExchangeServer |?{$_.ServerRole -ne "Mailbox" -and $_.AdminDisplayVersion -match "^Version 14"}
              Set-KeepAliveTime -Name $Servers -Reset
             
              Sets the KeepAliveTime on all the Exchamge 2010 Servers servers (CAS, HUB,
              Mailbox)to the reset setting. Which can be different from default.
             
              Suppose you find a setting of 4 hours is fine for moving large mailboxes.
              Change the script to
              The 21600000 for 6 hours

       Microsoft recomends is 5 Minutes for KeepAliveTime (2/17/2010)
       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\
       KeepAliveTime | Reg_DWORD | 0x000493e0 (300000) 
      
       Symantec recomends 15 minutes (July 15, 2011)
       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\
       KeepAliveTime | Reg_DWORD | 0x000dbba0 (900000) 
      
       We use Symantic's recomendation as our default.
