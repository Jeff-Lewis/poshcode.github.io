The idea is to filter a result of any cmdlet with less effort.

Where-like function works as a pipeline console filter.
The idea is to filter a result of any cmdlet with less effort.
I.g. Get-ChildItem 'C:\Windows' | Where-Like name *explo*

```posh
function Where-Like {
	Param($member, $string)
	process { $input | where {$_.$member -like $string} } 
}
```
