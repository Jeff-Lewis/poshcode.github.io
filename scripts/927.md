Script from SVN Utility

This script processes template files and produces and output file.
Its a simple macro processor really.
We use it to extract the latest version of our database procedurrads and functions
from our source code control server to create deployment scripts.

This will assume you have svn command line client in your path.
This currently cannot authenticate with svn to retrieve data. So just simple svn: supported.
This is written and tested with Microsoft Windows Powershell v1.0.

# Script from SVN Utility
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# This script processes template files and produces and output file.
# Its a simple macro processor really.
# We use it to extract the latest version of our database procedurrads and functions
# from our source code control server to create deployment scripts.
#
# This will assume you have svn command line client in your path.
# This currently cannot authenticate with svn to retrieve data. So just simple svn: supported.
# This is written and tested with Microsoft Windows Powershell v1.0.
#
# When run it will look for all files with ".dro" extension in the current
# directory and process them. If the ".dro" file does not specify the 
# OuputFile directive then the output file will have the same name as the
# input file with ".dro" replaced by ".out"
#
# GETTING STARTED
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Go to a directory containing a .dro file and execute "ScriptSVN.ps1" It will process all .dro files it finds.
# Look at $exampleInputFile below to see a sample input file content.
#
# This example will fail to get this example to work you will need
#	1. SVN Server called sccserver.
#   2. Files under the following path on SVN server
#		svn://sccserver/trunk/database/maindb/Procedure/ProcedureA.sql
#		svn://sccserver/trunk/database/maindb/Procedure/ProcedureB.sql
#		svn://sccserver/trunk/database/maindb/Procedure/ProcedureD.sql
#	3. The ProcedureD file must have a revision 43 available.
#
# File Format SYNTAX
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 1.	'#' marks start of script comment
#		Comments characters are converted to $comment on output to match output format.
#		Currently understands Single Quote strings and will mostly not identify a # in a string as a comment.
# 2.	'{' '}' mark start and end of a script directive.
#		Only recognised if the '{' is first non white space on a line. [simplifies search match a lot]
#		Only recognised if both start and end on same line.
#		The result of the directive is output to the file.
#		The output result is bracketed before and after by comments identifying the directive and parameters.
#		White space preceding a directive is prepended to each line output from directive [maintains indenting].
#		Extra data following a directive is completely ignored at the moment. 
# 3.	Other lines are output as they are
#
# A directive may have parameters.
# Directive parameters must use double quotes to quote things with spaces.
# For simplicity will always end up with a newline as last char in file.
# Simple understanding of single quoted strings wont find comment characters inside single quoted strings.
# Single quoted strings are supported because this was primarilly setup for SQL rollout scripts.
# Double quoted strings are not supported anywhere but inside directives.
#
# DIRECTIVES
# ~~~~~~~~~~
# OutputFile
#	set the name of file to write output.
#	No lines that produce output in file must precede the line its on [so make it first]
#	Or only after SourceControl line.
# SourceControl
#	Set the source control access string base path.
#	Must have trailing slash [ no it does not check it has it ]
#	eg.  svn://scc/project/trunk/Database/DBName/ for DBName procedures
# Reference
#	Extract a file from SourceControl with given path. eg. path  "Procedures/spnEmailMessageInsert.sql"
#	First parameter is path to file to fetch from source control.
#	Second parameter is an optional revision to retrieve of that file
#	Third paremter is an optional string to output to file as well [not sure how useful this is]
#		Inside this third parameter the string is processed for some special characters
#		"\n" represents a new line. useful for "GO\n".
#		"\t" represents a tab.
#		The conversion only occurs for output data not for the trace data output to file.
#
# Example. Build.cmd file that converts the .dro file(s) into our file
#	"powershell C:\Scripts\rollscript.ps1"
#
# HISTORY
# 2008/12/11 rluiten	Created.
# 2008/12/15 rluiten	Setup a v3.2 folder to test and fixed a bug or three.
#						Useful now maybe.
# 2008/12/17 rluiten	Added explicit revision retrieval to Reference.
#						Reference now looks up the revision to be able to output to file.
# 2009/02/23 rluiten	Corrected end of line outputs to CRLF.
#
# SOME EXTRA NOTES
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# We export our procedures and functions as a unit that drop themseles if they exist
# create themselves and then set permissions. This is the functional block of code we manage
# and track in our source code control server. This allows us to export the code from SQL again
# with another small script and do a file comparison to check we havnt missed a change or
# something hasnt snuck out to production without being in source control.
#
# Dont put identation in front of a {Reference} directive to a procedure as it will add indenting
# to the start of every line and your exported code if you wish to diff your database back to
# your source code control server will cause every line to be different.
#
# This utility is general and could be used for other stuff than SQL.
# However the single quote processing of strings not inside directives may limit some scenarios.
# This is the first script I have written so probably lots of things I can do better.
# Happy to have feedback.
# Hope someone finds this useful saves us here a lot of time keeping our deployment scripts
# correct as we work.

## Convert-Delimiter - A function to convert between different delimiters. 
## E.g.: commas to tabs, tabs to spaces, spaces to commas, etc.
################################################################################
	## Written primarily as a way of enabling the use of Import-CSV when
	## the source file was a columnar text file with data like services.txt:
	##         ip              service         port
	##         13.13.13.1      http            8000
	##         13.13.13.2      https           8001
	##         13.13.13.1      irc             6665-6669
	## 
	## Sample Use:  
	##    Get-Content services.txt | Convert-Delimiter " +" "," | Set-Content services.csv
	##         would convert the file above into something that could passed to:
	##         Import-Csv services.csv
	##
	##    Get-Content Delimited.csv | Convert-Delimiter "," "`t" | Set-Content Delimited.tab
	##         would convert a simple comma-separated-values file to a tab-delimited file
	################################################################################
	## Version History
	## Version 1.0
	##	  First working version
	## Version 2.0
	##    Fixed the quoting so it adds quotes in case they're neeeded
	## Version 2.1
	##    Remove quotes which aren't needed
	## Version 2.2
	##    Trim spaces off the ends, they confuse things
	## Version 2.3
	##    Allow empty columns: as in: there,are,six,"comma, delimited",,columns
	## Version 2.3
	##    Replaced Trim() with regex to do similar job.
	##    if a parameter is "" <-- empty string this captures the "Quotes" as its value not empty string ???
