# PowerShell Template

I created this function to generate a new PowerShell Script template. I've modified it to prompt for the file name, eMail, and finally you can add a comment. The tricky part was trimmimg the comment so it would wrap properly. I use this all the time. Enjoy.

```posh
Function New-Script
{
$strName = $env:username
$date = get-date -format d
$name = Read-Host "Filename"
if ($name -eq "") { $name="NewTemplate" }
$email = Read-Host "eMail Address"
if ($email -eq "") { $email="genemagerr@hotmail.com" }
$comment=@();
while($s = (Read-Host "Comment").Trim()){$comment+="$s`r`n#"}
$file = New-Item -type file "$name.ps1" -force
$template=@"
