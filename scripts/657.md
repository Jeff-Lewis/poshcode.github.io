# Script Listing

### [download](657.ps1)

Do you have too many scripts to be useful, this might help.
In each of your scripts put a one line description prefixed with "# Purpose:"
Your output will be a listing of your scripts and a one line description.

In your profile script add the following:


```posh
$pathToScripts = "C:\Scripts\*"

foreach($itm in get-childitem $pathToScripts -include *.ps1 -recurse)
  {"{0,-25}{1,0}" -f ((" " + $itm.name) -replace ".ps1",""), ((get-content $itm | where {$_ -like "*Purpose:*"}) -replace "# Purpose: ","")}
```
