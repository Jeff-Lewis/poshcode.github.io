description:    Script to run daily send/receive reports in .csv format on a Exchange 2007 server using Power Shell 1.

I originally found part of this code somewhere else but it didn't properly report the number of messages sent/received.  I cleaned it up and have been running it every morning on our Exchange Server.  It's nothing fancy but it gives good information.

Script to run daily send/receive reports in .csv format on a Exchange 2007 server using Power Shell 1.

I originally found part of this code somewhere else but it didn't properly report the number of messages sent/received.  I cleaned it up and have been running it every morning on our Exchange Server.  It's nothing fancy but it gives good information.

# Get the start date for the tracking log search
$Start = (Get-Date -Hour 00 -Minute 00 -Second 00).AddDays(-1)

# Get the end date for the tracking log search
$End = (Get-Date -Hour 23 -Minute 59 -Second 59).AddDays(-1)

#Create a date for the csv file that this will get spit into
$date = get-date -Format MM-dd-yyyy

# Declare an array to store the results
$Results = @()

# Get the SEND events from the message tracking logs

$Total = $Mailboxes.Count
$Count = 1

# Sort the mailboxes and pipe them to a For-Each loop
$Mailboxes | Sort-Object DisplayName | ForEach-Object {
	# Update the progress bar
