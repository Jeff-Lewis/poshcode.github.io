A script to determine if what printerques that are active

```posh
#PrinterChecking Script By Henrik Pedersen Åmark and Daniel Lundgren

#This script is designed to check what printers that is still in use.
#It's assumed the printer is classed as inactive if it hasnt been used in X months
#The script is reading the Systemlog on a printserver of your choice, the one you type in the hostname for,
#sorting the log on eventID 10 (successful print) and searching for entries the latest 6 months.
#When its done it gets printer ports and ques from the same server and then compare them to the messageline from the eventlog.
#And then checking if the mportname of is in the message.
#If it is, it will write the name to a file and if not it will write the name to another file.

#You will need admin rights to use the script.
