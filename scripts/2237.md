description:    Password gerneration function originally posted on PoshCode.org by Sean Kearney.  Without any arguments, Get-NewPassword generates an 8 character password with upper, lower, and numeric characters.  It can accept 2 options, the first is password length (up to 94 chars) and the other is complexity (1 to 4).  I had to modify the code so that it wouldn't create repeating characters.  The code may be ugly, but it's because I am a network admin and not a programmer.  I hope it helps someone.

# Description: Password gerneration function based upon code
#              originally posted on PoshCode.org by Sean Kearney
#              
#		Usage: Without any arguments, Get-NewPassword
#			   generates an 8 character password with
#			   upper, lower, and numeric characters.
#			   It can accept 2 options, the first is
#			   password length (up to 94) and the other
#			   is complexity (1 to 4). The complexity
#			   Levels are:
#			   1 - Lowercase characters only
#			   2 - Lower and Uppercase characters
#			   3 - Upper, Lower and Numeric (default)
#			   4 - Upper, Lower, Numeric, and Special chars
#			   *Passwords generated do NOT reuse characters
#			    and attempt to avoid creating repeating series
#			    of characters, like abc or 123
