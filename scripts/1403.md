# Get-PrimaryIPAddress

### [download](1403.ps1)

As seen on http://halr9000.com/article/829#comments. Needs some prettying up with help and stuff but should work well.

```posh
[system.Net.NetworkInformation.NetworkInterface]::GetAllNetworkInterfaces() |
	Where-Object { $_.GetIPProperties().GatewayAddresses } |
		ForEach-Object {
			$_.GetIPProperties().UnicastAddresses| ForEach-Object {
				$_.Address.IPAddressToString
			}
		}
```
