        .Synopsis
        Searches one or more Exchange transport logs and sends the output to XML.
       
        .DESCRIPTION
        Creates a PowerShell job for each Exchange transport server to be searched and
        that job searches based onteh parameters defined in the search.  
       
        The output is exported as XML to the path defined.  By default only 4 jobs
        run at a time.  As jobs complete additional jobs are submitted.
               
        .PARAMETER ComputerName
        One or more computer names (Exchange transort servers) to search.
               
        .PARAMETER Start
        The start time of the search
               
        .PARAMETER End
        The end time of the search
               
        .PARAMETER Sender
        Return results where the sender matches this address
               
        .PARAMETER Recipient
        Return results for e-mail addressed to the recipient provided.
               
        .PARAMETER EventId
        The eventId of the tracking event to match.
               
        .PARAMETER Threshold
        How many transport jobs to spawn at one time.
       
        .PARAMETER Path
        Where to create the resulting XML files.  The default is the current working directory.
               
        .EXAMPLE
        Start-TransportLogSearch -ComputerName server01a,server01b,server01c -Start (get-date "08/01/2013 00:00") -end (get-date 08/02/2013 "00:00") -EventId RECEIVE -Sender 'bill@microsoft.com'
       
        This starts 3 PowerShell jobs that run in parallel that searches for all mail with the
        eventId of RECEIVE that was submitted by Mr. Gates 08/01/2013 through 08/02/2013.
               
        .EXAMPLE
        $start     = (get-date).addDays(-3)
        $end       = (get-date)
        $recipient = 'john_smith@contoso.com'
        $path      = 'c:\Temp\ExchangeLogs'
        Get-TransportServer | Start-TransportLogSearch -start $start -end $end -recipient $recipient -Path $path
       
        This starts a transport log search against all transport servers in the Exchange organization for mail addressed to
        john_smith@contoso.com that has been submitted over the past 3 days.  Each job that is spawned will generate an XML
        file that will be deposited in c:\Temp\ExchangeLogs that can be processed later.
