# Copy Shares 

### [download](4630.ps1)

Copies shared folders from one server to another. Run on the new server (as administrator).
Tested during migration of SBS 2003 to SBS 2011

```posh
$oldserver = "hostname"
# Exclude the following shares. Update to particular needs of your environment.
$excludes = @("DLOAgent","faxclient","CertEnroll","Resources$","FxsSrvCp$","tsweb","NETLOGON","WSUSTemp","prnproc$","SYSVOL","Address","tsclient","WsusContent","UpdateServicesPackages","print$")
$shares = get-wmiobject -computername $oldserver -Class win32_share|where-object {($_.type -eq 0) -and ($excludes -notcontains $_.name)}

foreach ($share in $shares)
 {
 #  This section was required as the old server had a C: and a D:
 #  The new server had only a C: so had to edit the paths to replace any reference of D: with C:
 	if ($share.path -like "D:*")
 	    {
		$newntfspath = $share.path.replace("D:\","C:\")
		Write-Host -foregroundcolor Green "Destination folder" $newntfspath
		}
	else {  $newntfspath = $share.path
		Write-Host -foregroundcolor Green "Destination folder" $newntfspath
		}

#       Test to see if the file paths already exist - only needed on the first run if you intend to robocopy more than once.

	    if (!(Test-Path $newntfspath))
		{
		Write-Host -foregroundcolor Green "Folder $newntfspath does not exist"
		Write-Host -foregroundcolor Green "Starting robocopy job"
#       Robocopy job - requires that the log folder exists already - in this case C:\RobocopyLogs
		robocopy \\$oldserver\$($share.name) $newntfspath /W:5 /R:2 /XO /E /PURGE /SEC /V /NFL /LOG:C:\RobocopyLogs\$($share.name).txt
