Please note that, for 2017, we experienced significant on-site technical problems and equipment failures (including one instance of the "magic smoke" escaping from the recording equipment). Between the venue's video scalers, 4K projectors, and our recorders, many of the video recordings ended up cropped. In addition, we had significant problems maintaining audio line levels. We appreciate your understanding that our on-site priority was to the attendees who paid to be there in person, and recordings are captured on a "best effort" basis. We apologize if a session that you were looking for was not recorded, or if the recording is not to the quality that you had hoped for. Going forward, you should absolutely plan to attend Summit in person, as we will, AT MOST, attempt to record only a SELECTION of sessions from our 4+ tracks.
