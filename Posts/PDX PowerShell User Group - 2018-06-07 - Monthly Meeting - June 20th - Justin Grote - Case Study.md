Powershell for Fun and Profit!: Justin Grote will take us through a case study on how his company, Allied Digital Services LLC, leverages Powershell to enhance their managed services infrastructure to drive a revenue-generating IT organization. The overview will start small with "lazy engineering" (fixing/automating repetitive tasks) and work up to fully automated integrations with Powershell modules both on-premise and using Azure Functions/Automation/DSC.
