# Set-Prompt

### [download](//scripts/3198.ps1) - [parent](//scripts/2095.md)

My command prompt, as always. I leave this in _a separate script file_ and invoke it from my profile. That way I can RE-invoke it to reset my prompt if I have to mess with it for some reason.

I recently embedded my _persistent history_ functionality directly into this prompt function (I used to have that in a per-host profile, as a wrapper around this prompt, but I can't remember why, and I didn't like loosing it when I had to re-invoke this script).

```posh
#.Synopsis
#  Sets my favorite prompt function
#.Notes
#  I put the id in my prompt because it's very, very useful.
#
#  Invoke-History and my Expand-Alias and Get-PerformanceHistory all take command history IDs
#  Also, you can tab-complete with "#<id>[Tab]" so .
#  For example, the following commands:
#  r 4
#  ## r is an alias for invoke-history, so this reruns your 4th command
#
#  #6[Tab]
#  ## will tab-complete whatever you typed in your 6th command (now you can edit it)
#
#  Expand-Alias -History 6,8,10 > MyScript.ps1
#  ## generates a script from those history items
#
#  GPH -id 6, 8
#  ## compares the performance of those two commands ...
#
param(
   # Controls how much history we keep in the command log
   [Int]$PersistentHistoryCount = 30,
   # If set, we use a pasteable prompt with <# #> around the prompt info
   [Alias("copy","demo")][Switch]$Pasteable, 
   [Int]$global:MaximumHistoryCount = 2048,
   [ConsoleColor]$global:PromptForeground = "Yellow", 
   [ConsoleColor]$global:ErrorForeground = "Red"
)

# Some stuff goes OUTSIDE the prompt function because it doesn't need re-evaluation

# I set the title in my prompt every time, because I want the current PATH location there,
# rather than in my prompt where it takes up too much space.

# But I want other stuff too. I  calculate an initial prefix for the window title
# The title will show the PowerShell version, user, current path, and whether it's elevated or not
# E.g.:"PoSh3 Jaykul@HuddledMasses (ADMIN) - C:\Your\Path\Here (FileSystem)" 
if(!$global:WindowTitlePrefix) {
   $global:WindowTitlePrefix = "PoSh$($PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major) ${Env:UserName}@${Env:UserDomain}"
   
   # if you're running "elevated" we want to show that:
   $ENV:PROCESS_ELEVATED = ([System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version.Major -gt 5) -and ( # Vista and ...
                              new-object Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal (
                              [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()) # current user is admin
                           ).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)
   
   if($ENV:PROCESS_ELEVATED) {
      $global:WindowTitlePrefix += " (ADMIN)"
   }
}

if($MyInvocation.HistoryId -eq 1) {
   $ProfileDir = Split-Path $Profile.CurrentUserAllHosts
   ## Import my history
