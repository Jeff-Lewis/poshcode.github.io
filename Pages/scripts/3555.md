# Detect SCCM 2007

### [download](//scripts/3555.ps1)

This is a VERY simple Powershell Function to test if the SCCM 2007 Agent is installed on a machine or not.

All it actually does is return a Boolean True/False if the Agent is detected in a computer that is powered on.

that's all.  It was useful for me, it might be useful for somebody else.  Use is simple, run the Function and now you can use

TEST-SCCMAgent -PC computername



```posh
function global:test-sccmagent {
param($PC)
[boolean]$result=get-wmiobject -Query "Select * from win32_service where Name = 'CcmExec'" -ComputerName $PC
return $result
}

```
