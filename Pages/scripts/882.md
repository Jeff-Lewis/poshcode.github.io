# Get-NetView

### [download](//scripts/882.ps1)

A one liner that parses the output of NET.EXE's VIEW command. NET.EXE VIEW displays a list of computers in your current domain by default, to display another domain change it to read NET.EXE VIEW /domain <domainName>.

```posh
function Get-NetView {
	switch -regex (NET.EXE VIEW) { "^\\\\(?<Name>\S+)\s+" {$matches.Name}}
	}

```
