# Start-Elevated

### [download](//scripts/165.ps1)

A simple function based on http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2007/02/25/22315.aspx to launch a process elevated -- basically, this is the UAC equivalent of sudo (and therefore, will almost always require you to at least click OK).

```posh
#function Start-Elevated {
   param ($app) 
   $psi = new-object "System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo"
   $psi.FileName = $app; 
   $psi.Arguments = [string]$args; 
   $psi.Verb = "runas";
   [System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start($psi)
#}
```
