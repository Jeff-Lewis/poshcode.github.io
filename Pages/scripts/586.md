# SCOM-RunRemoteExecutable

### [download](//scripts/586.ps1)

Used as a notification command channel in SCOM, this script will (theoretically) spawn a process on a remote machine - used for creating a sound on an admin console, such as in a NOC. 
For the most part, you'll probably need to embed credentials in this, which I disagree with and won't add.

# NAME: SCOM-RunRemoteExecutable.ps1
#
# AUTHOR: Jeremy D. Pavleck , Pavleck.NET
# DATE  : 9/13/2008
#
# COMMENT: This is a Proof Of Concept script written in response to a mailing list request to
#               enable OpsMgr to sound an audible alert on a remote admin PC, such as a console in a
#               NOC.
#               This is to be run as a Notification Command Channel.
#
# NOTES/WARNING: This script uses a remote WMI call to spawn a process on a named server. As
#               such, there are security issues to keep in mind. I haven’t added the code to allow you
#               to use alternate credentials, but use http://poshcode.org/501 as a jumping off point.
#               If you’re running the OpsMgr services under a domain account, add that user to the local
#               administrators group on the machine you want to run this command. If you’re using local
#               system, add RMS\Local System to the admin group.
#               RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK!
#
# VERSIONS:
#               v1.0 - 09/12/2008 - Initial version
#               v1.1 - 09/13/2008 - On the advice of Pete Zerger, added a throttling routine to prevent
#                                                       to many executions during an alert storm
#               v1.2 - 09/13/2008 - Changed variable names to make it a more ‘run remote executable’ script
