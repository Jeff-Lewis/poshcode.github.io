# Search-Network

### [download](//scripts/3063.ps1)

This is my first real PowerShell script, not sure if anyone has done anything liek this before (I'm sure it has been done) but I figured Iâ€™d share it anyway. Makes use of a function I found on here by Nathan Hartley called Get-NetView.
Script searches all viewable machines on the network, tests to see if they are online, tests to see if a particular service is installed, if service isn't found it will add the PC's name to an error log, if the service exists but isn't running it will try to start it. A second log is also created that shows all actions.
I built this to check that all machines on our network are running our anti-virus (yes the server reports this, but I just wanted to have something like this available if need be for other services / processes.)
Let me know what you guys think I, I want to get better so criticism / encouragement is appreciated.
Change Lines 5,6,7 to suit your needs, should run out of the box as long as you have a directory c:\temp.
Thanks, Patrick
