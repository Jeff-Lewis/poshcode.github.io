# Get-LeaderBoard

### [download](//scripts/2632.ps1) - [parent](//scripts/2629.md)

Script to retrieve the leader boards from the 2011 Scripting Games as objects.  New version fixes an error with regex that caused usernames with periods or other non-english characters to be excluded (Thanks to Scott Alvarino for noticing this).  Also added rankings, which unfortunately causes PowerShell to default the display to a list format, but I assume that any PowerSheller looking at the leaderboards is capable of piping the output to "Format-Table -AutoSize" :)
