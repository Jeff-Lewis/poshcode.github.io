# NewUser in AD/OCS/Email

### [download](//scripts/1491.ps1)

A Powershell Script meant for a novice to understand how to work with Variables.  I use it daily.  Creates a user via Exchange 2007 and automatically populates the email address by defined policy.  Using supplied scriptlets (referenced in PS1 file) it also populates the Users' info in OCS 2007 R2 standard as well as populates all fields in A/D with pertinent info.  It also sets up the Display name in a Lastname, Firstname format and creates the users home folder with permissions allocated to the user only.   The only information it requests is Firstname, Lastname and Password.  It is easy to modify to make it a bulk user setup.  Thank you Jeffrey Snover and Microsoft for Powershell!

# New User In PowerShell 
# ye110wbeard (EnergizedTech) Finally shuts up and writes a script that is USEFUL and doesn't sing about it 
# 7/15/2009 :) 
# And it couldn't have happened if it wasn't for the Powershell Community 
# 
# This script in many ways is VERY simple.  I simply chose to use simple assignments instead of a fancy "CSV Import" so a Powershell 
# Newbie might be able to look at it, and get a better grasp of what everything is in Active Directory when THEY want to do something similiar 
# 
# For Newbie Users, a line beginning with a '#' is a comment.   If you put a '#' the line will be ignored. 

# Prompt User for FirstName and LastName of new user 

$FirstName = read-host -Prompt "Enter User First Name: " 
$LastName = read-host -Prompt "Enter User Last Name: " 

# Password must be read from Console as Secure String to be applied.  If you're manipulate this to a Batch User process, you can use this one password as a default.  The Exchange New-Mailbox has the "Change Password at login" enabled by default

# Tips.  If you do have Office Communications Server or Live Comm and looking for the Variables used, Check an enabled user in Active Directory while in ADVANCED mode 
# and choose the "Attribute Editor" tab.  You'll find them all down there.   If it doesn't say "Enabled" or contain a value?  Don't use it
