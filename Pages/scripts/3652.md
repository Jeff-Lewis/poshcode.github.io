I have primarily used this to trim browser WorkingSet data. Tested on firefox / iexplore / chrome. It works with no tab crashing.
Trimming Working Set data, doesnt mean that browser Working Set values wont climb to their previous numbers.
I have seen some IE windows go back to similar working set numbers.

However, this script is really useful for a stuck browser and freezing screeing situations.

.EXAMPLE
.\TrimWorkingSet.ps1 1920
#>

$sig = @"
[DllImport("kernel32.dll")]
public static extern bool SetProcessWorkingSetSize( IntPtr proc, int min, int max );
"@

$apptotrim = (get-process -Id $procid).Handle
Add-Type -MemberDefinition $sig -Namespace User32 -Name Util -UsingNamespace System.Text -PassThru
[User32.Util]::SetProcessWorkingSetSize($apptotrim,-1,-1)
}
TrimWorkingSet(5960)

```
