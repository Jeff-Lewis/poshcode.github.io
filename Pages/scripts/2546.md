# Set-ToStringMethod

### [download](//scripts/2546.ps1)

Using created on-the-fly ps1xml it will change .ToString() method of a given type to scriptblock provided by user. No checking performed so you may end up with completely useless ToString() method. But since default one (if I'm not mistaken inherited from System.Object) is as useless as possible (returns object's type fullname, see examples for output before after, you will get the picture... ;)

```posh
function Set-ToStringMethod {

<#
    .Synopsis
        Overwrites default .ToString() method of a given type.
    .Description
        Some commands use .ToString() method of an object to produce output.
        Default (inherited from System.Object) result of that method is object's type FullName.
        That is usually not very interesting and useful - thus need to replace it with something else.
        Use $this special variable inside ScriptBlock to refer to object's properties and methods.
    .Example
        Set-ToStringMethod -TypeName System.Array -ScriptBlock { ($this | foreach { $_.ToString() ) -Join ';' }
        
        Results of:
        (1,2,3,4,(Get-Date)).ToString()
        Before:
        System.Object[]
        After:
        1;2;3;4;07/03/2011 23:09:20
        
        What do you prefer? Meaningless name of the type or string representation of members? Choice is yours... ;)
