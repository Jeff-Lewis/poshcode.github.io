# Lead Systems Engineer

### [download](//scripts/3798.ps1)

Never fails a user calls in or enters a helpdesk ticket with, “I can’t log in”.  This is a script provides everything I need to determine why: Password Expired? Account Locked? If Locked, which DCs? Are there other users that are locked, that haven’t noticed yet?

This replaces using AD and the Account Lockout Status Tool.  It not only saves a little time, but has everything in one place.
