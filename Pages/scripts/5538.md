# Get-GroupStructure

### [download](//scripts/5538.ps1) - [parent](//scripts/5536.md)

This simple function exports the structure of nested groups in a similar way as folder and file structures are usually presented.

It is also a part of another really simple powershell form that end users can use to export members of Active Directory groups.

It requires the Active Directory module to run.

Blog post with a link the PowerShell form is available at:

Edit: missed something in the comment based help. Sorry...

           [string] $GroupName)

    $GroupMembers = @()
    $GroupMembers += Get-ADGroupMember $GroupName | Sort-Object objectClass -Descending

    $LoopCount = @($GroupPath -split " \\ " | Where-Object { $_ -eq $GroupName })
