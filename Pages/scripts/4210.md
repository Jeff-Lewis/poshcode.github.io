    .SYNOPSIS
    Does a little html scraping to get a random quote from the Simpsons.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Use with caution. 

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-SimpsonQuote

    Homer: About last night. You might have noticed Daddy acting a little strange and you probably don't understand why.
    Bart: I understand why. You were wasted.
    Homer: I admit it. I didn't know when to say "when." I'm sorry it happened and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.
    Bart: Dad, I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will.
