# Save-CurrentFile (ISE)

### [download](//scripts/1318.ps1)

Why to use a FileselectionBox to save your fresh files from ISE, don't you know your file system? OK perhaps an encoding parameter would be fine, but please don't default it to ASCII.
 

```posh
function Save-CurrentFile ($path)
{
    $psISE.CurrentFile.SaveAs($path)
    $psISE.CurrentFile.Save([Text.Encoding]::default)

}

# Save-CurrentFile '.\Save-CurrentFile.ps1'


```
