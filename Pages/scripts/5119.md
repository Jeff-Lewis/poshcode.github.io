# gather/take

### [download](//scripts/5119.ps1)

Port of Perl 6's gather/take (which itself is a port of Mathematica's Reap/Sow)

```posh
function gather {
#.SYNOPSIS
#  Port of Perl 6's gather/take (which itself is a port of Mathematica's Reap/Sow)
#.EXAMPLE
#  gather { 1 ; take 2 ; 3 ; take 4 5 }
#  2
#  4
#  5
#.NOTES
#  PowerShell doesn't really need this since the pipeline does this by default
#  (and does a much better job since it works by using a push streaming model)
#  but it's useful in the rare cases that it's necessary.
