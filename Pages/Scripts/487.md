#Create a snapshot of all the vm's in a folder, 
#be sure to change to match your enviroment. use at your own risk, snapshots have been known to 
#cause certain configurations to lock (freeze) so test in a dev enviroment first.

$vCenter = VirtualCenterServer
$vFolder = VirtualCenterFolder
$sName = SnapshotName


Get-vc -server $vCenter
#remove old snapshots with the same name
Get-Folder $vFolder | get-vm | Get-Snapshot -Name $sName | Remove-Snapshot -Confirm:$false
#create a snapshot of each vm in that folder
Get-Folder $vFolder | get-vm | new-snapshot -Name $sName | ConvertTo-Html | Out-File create.htm

$smtpclient = New-Object System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient
