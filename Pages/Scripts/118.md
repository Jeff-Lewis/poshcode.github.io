# Select-Random v2.2

### [download](Scripts\118.ps1) - [parent](Scripts\83.md)

Select a user-defined number of random elements from the collection ... which can be passed as a parameter or input via the pipeline. An improvement over http://www.powershellcentral.com/scripts/60 which allows you to select more than one item, but offers the option to collect the pipeline into RAM to trade speed for memory use (replaces 81 and 83).

### <Description>
### Selects a random element from the collection either passed as a parameter or input via the pipeline.
### If the collection is passed in as an argument, we simply pick a random number between 0 and count-1
### for each element you want to return, but when processing pipeline input we want to keep memory use 
### to a minimum, so we use a "reservoir sampling" algorithm[1].
###
### [1] http://gregable.com/2007/10/reservoir-sampling.html
###
### The script stores $count elements (the eventual result) at all times. It continues processing 
### elements until it reaches the end of the input. For each input element $n (the count of the inputs 
### so far) there is a $count/$n chance that it becomes part of the result.
### * For each previously selected element, there is a $count/($n-1) chance of it being selected 
### * For the ones selected, there's a ($count/$n * 1/$count = 1/$n) chance of it being replaced, so a 
###   ($n-1)/$n chance of it remaining ... thus, it's cumulative probability of being among the selected
###   elements after the nth input is processed is $count/($n-1) * ($n-1)/$n = $count/$n, as it should be.

### <Usage>
### $arr = 1..5; Select-Random $arr
### 1..10 | Select-Random -Count 2
### </Usage>
### <Version>2.2.0.0</Version>
### <History>
### <V id="2.0.0.0">Rewrote using the reservoir sampling technique</V>
### <V id="2.1.0.0">Fixed a bug in 2.0 which inverted the probability and resulted in the last n items being selected with VERY high probability</V>
### <V id="2.2.0.0">Use more efficient direct random sampling if the collection is passed as an argument</V>
### </History>

Usage: Select-Random [[-Count] <int>] [-inputObject] <array> (from pipeline) [-?]

Parameters:
 -Count            : The number of elements to select.
 -inputObject      : The collection from which to select a random element.
 -collectionMethod : Collect the pipeline input instead of using reservoir
 -?                : Display this usage information and exit

Examples:
 PS> $arr = 1..5; Select-Random $arr
 PS> 1..10 | Select-Random -Count 2
