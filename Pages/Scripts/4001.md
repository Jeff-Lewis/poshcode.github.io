# Copy-Shares

### [download](Scripts\4001.ps1)

This script "copies" shares and share permissions from one computer to another. The drive letter can change between computers, but the path(s) on the drive may not. This script does not copy the data; for that you will need another solution, such as xcopy or a decent SAN that can do it for you. It works on OSes as old as Windows 2000, and at least as new as Server 2008 R2. It probably has a hundred possible improvements.
