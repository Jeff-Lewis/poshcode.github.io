# Test-VmMigration

### [download](Scripts\3005.ps1)

Purpose: Test that a VMware Virtual Machine can be migrated (vMotion) to another host system (ESX Server), without performing the migration.

Problem Statement: Migrations can often fail due to various configuration issues. The vSphere Client GUI is able to determine these configuration issues during a migration check that is performed prior to an actual migration. A method of recreating this validation is required in order to ensure that a scheduled migration will succeed. This will give the administrator the time to resolve any configuration issues prior to a planned change going into effect.

v0.01: Skeleton code, needs a lot of work. I haven't figured out what to do with $Results yet

```posh
$vv = get-vm testsql17b | get-view
$si = Get-View ServiceInstance -Server $global:DefaultVIServers[1]
$hs = get-vmhost infesx52*
$hv = $hs | Get-View
$pool = $vv.ResourcePool
$vmMoRef = $vv.MoRef
$hsMoRef = $hv.MoRef
$si = Get-View ServiceInstance -Server $global:DefaultVIServers[1] # this turned out to be futile, later line returns multi objects anyway...
$VmProvCheck = get-view $si.Content.VmProvisioningChecker # don't know why it grabbed multiple objs, one for each vCenter
$RavVmProvCheck = $VmProvCheck[0] # This is the object we need for the VC instance in question
$results = $RavVmProvCheck.CheckMigrate( $vmMoRef, $hsMoRef, $pool, $null, $null )
```
