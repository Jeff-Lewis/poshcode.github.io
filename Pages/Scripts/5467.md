# Delete Empty Folders

### [download](Scripts\5467.ps1) - [parent](Scripts\3690.md)

This is a script to remove empty folders from a drive. I used it when i had to clear up a shared drive from a former company.
Please let me know if you know a way i can improve it.
Nice script.  I added a check to exclude folders with one or more subfolders but have no files.

```posh
$Drive = Read-Host "Path to Folders"
Write-Host "This will delete all empty folders in this directory!"
$a = Get-ChildItem $drive -recurse | Where-Object {$_.PSIsContainer -eq $True}
@@$a | Where-Object {($_.GetFiles().Count -lt 1 -and $_.GetDirectories().Count -lt 1)} | Select-Object FullName | ForEach-Object {remove-item $_.fullname -recurse} 
Write-Host "All Done!"
```
