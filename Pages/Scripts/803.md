# Out-Default URL Launcher

### [download](Scripts\803.ps1)

This bad boy is from an email by Bruce Payette--the master.  Here are some notes from the email:

"Add the function below to your profile and you should have what you want. By overriding Out-Default,
this function can do a couple of things. First, it captures the last object written in
$GLOBAL:LAST. The more germane feature is that it traps any errors that are written. If the error is
"command not found" and the command takes the form of "http://msdn.microsoft.com" or "live.com" it
uses [diagnostics.process]::start() to launch the browser (this could just be start-process in V2). Finally,
if the command name resolves to a directory, it cd's to that directory.

This works in both the console host and the ISE but the implementation depends on our host convention - that
all output and errors are routed through Out-Default, so it may not work in other hosts." - Bruce Payette

```posh
# Wrapper for Out-Default that saves the last object written
# and handles missing commands if the command is a directory
# or an URL

function Out-Default `

   [CmdletBinding(ConfirmImpact="Medium")]
   param(
       [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline=$true)] `
       [System.Management.Automation.PSObject] $InputObject
   )

   begin
   {
     $wrappedCmdlet = $ExecutionContext.InvokeCommand.GetCmdlet(
       "Out-Default")
     $sb = { & $wrappedCmdlet @PSBoundParameters }
     $__sp = $sb.GetSteppablePipeline()
     $__sp.Begin($pscmdlet)
   }
   process {

       $do_process = $true
       if ($_ -is [System.Management.Automation.ErrorRecord])
       {
           if ($_.Exception -is [System.Management.Automation.CommandNotFoundException])
           {
               $__command = $_.Exception.CommandName
               if (test-path -path $__command -pathtype container)
