# Get Processor Inventory

### [download](Scripts\5114.ps1) - [parent](Scripts\5083.md)

Script originally developed for internal DBAs to get information on processor core counts, which is important for licensing. This script includes some basic error handling and full comment based help. Output properties are Computer, Socket (Designation), Core Count, Logical Processors, Hyperthreading Enabled, Description and Type (Physical/Virtual). Update 4/23/14: I added a warning message when running against OS' older than Win 7/Server 2008; it appears older versions of WMI do not support some of the properties from the win32_processor class found in newer OS'.

<#
	.SYNOPSIS
		Returns information about the Processor via WMI. 

	.DESCRIPTION
		Information about the processor is returned using the Win32_Processor WMI class. 

		You can provide a single computer/server name or supply an array/list.

		Operating systems prior to Windows 7 & Server 2008 may not return accurate results due to the difference in WMI versions.

	.PARAMETER  Computers
		Single computer name, list of computers or .txt file containing a list of computers.

	.EXAMPLE
		.\Get-ProcessorInventory.ps1 -Computers (Get-Content C:\ComputerList.txt)

	.EXAMPLE
		.\Get-ProcessorInventory.ps1 -Computers Test-Server.company.com

	.EXAMPLE
		.\Get-ProcessorInventory.ps1 -Computers SERVER1.company.com,SERVER2.company.com | Format-Table -AutoSize

	.EXAMPLE
		.\Get-ProcessorInventory.ps1 -Computers SERVER1.company.com,SERVER2.company.com | Export-Csv C:\ProcInv.csv -NoTypeInformation

	.INPUTS
		System.String

	.OUTPUTS
		Selected.System.Management.ManagementObject
