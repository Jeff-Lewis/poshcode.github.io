# Get-Password

### [download](Scripts\2793.ps1)

I have constantly been looking for a quick and lightweight way to generate random passwords of varrying length and complexity and ended up writting this.  A random password generator that if added to a folder in your system path can be called by using Get-Password with optional parameters to control the length and how complex of a character set is used.  I use this when creating service account passwords.

.SYNOPSIS

Generate a random password.

.DESCRIPTION

The Get-Password function generates a random password from a pre-generated array of characters based of the length and complexity paramters defined at run time.  If no parameters are supplied the function defaults to a length of 9 characters and the high complexity character set which includes upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and symbols.  The output is written to the console and is not stored anywhere else.

.PARAMETER -PasswordLength

Defines the number of random characters to generate for the password.  Also can be called by two alliases to provide for less typing which are -PassLen and -PL.

.PARAMETER -ComplexityLevel

Defines the complexity level of the password.  The options to be used are H for high complexity, M for medium complexity and L for low complexity.  Also can be called by the alias -CL.

.EXAMPLE

Generate a random password with the default settings of high complexity and 9 characters

Get-Password

.EXAMPLE 

Generate a password with 20 characters and low complexity(i.e. only letters)

Get-Password -PasswordLength 20 -ComplexityLevel L
