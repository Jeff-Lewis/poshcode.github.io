I want to get this importing my $AllMembers to my $List in Sharepoint.

```posh
import-module activedirectory

#open it
$web = $site.OpenWeb()

#defines the list we are looking for
$list = $web.Lists["SP_List_AD_Names"]

#for each item found in SP_LIST_AD_NAMES, go hard and find the AD information
foreach ($listItem in $list.Items)
{
    $SubGroups = @()

    #Create an empty array
    $AllMembers = @()
    
    #Populate it with all recursive members of the group
    $strGroupOwner = Get-ADGroup -identity $listItem.name -Properties ManagedBy | select managedby
    $strOwnerName = get-aduser -identity $strGroupOwner.managedby -properties samaccountname |select -ExpandProperty samaccountname
    $strGroupName = $listItem.Name
    "Group is named: " + $strGroupName
    "Group is owned by: " + $strOwnerName
    
    
    ForEach($Person in (Get-ADGroupMember $listItem.name -Recursive)){
        $totalCount ++
        $User = Get-ADUser $Person -Property description
    
        $AllMembers += New-Object PSObject -Property @{
    
            Name = $Person.Name
