# Timespan SMTP Headers

### [download](Scripts\879.ps1)

This reads in a set of SMTP headers, and displays the MTA's the message passed through, in chronological order, and calculates and displays the message latency (time it spent there) between each one.  The latency for the first received header as well as the total message time is calculated from the Date: header timestamp on the email.  MTAs with out-of-sync clocks should show up as negative latencies, or a mismatch between the accumulated lantencies and the calculated total time.

```posh
$hdr_txt = gc ./hdr.txt

$rec_hdr_regex = [regex]"^Received\:\sfrom\s(.+?)\sby\s(.+?)\;\s(.+?\d\d\:\d\d\:\d\d\s[+|-]\d{4})"


$from_hdr = $hdr_txt | select-string "^From\:\s.+$"
$rec_block = $hdr_txt[0..$($from_hdr.linenumber -2)]
$rec_lines = $rec_block | select-string "^Received\:\sfrom"
$sent_hdr = $hdr_txt | select-string "^Date\:\s.+$"
$sent_hdr.line -match "^Date\:\s(.+)$" > $nul
$sent_ts = [datetime]$matches[1]

foreach ($rec_line in $rec_lines[1..$($rec_lines.count -1)]){$rec_block[$rec_line.linenumber -1] = "~" + $rec_line.line}
$rec_hdrs  = $([string]$rec_block).split("~")


Write-host "`nMessage sent $($sent_ts)`n"

$i = $rec_hdrs.count -1
$last_ts = $sent_ts

while ($i -ge 0) {
$rec_hdrs[$i] -match $rec_hdr_regex > $nul
$rec_ts = [datetime]$matches[3] 
$latency = $rec_ts - $last_ts
$last_ts = $rec_ts
write-host "latency is $($latency.totalseconds) seconds`n"
write-host $matches[1]   
$i--
}

Write-host "`nMessage received $($last_ts)"
write-host "Total time is $($($last_ts - $sent_ts).seconds) seconds.`n"
